# Game Flow

**Phase 2: Core Mechanics - Lesson 1**

Now that you understand the objective, let's learn how a game actually unfolds. Mahjong has a beautiful rhythm: draw, consider, discard, repeat. Understanding the turn structure and game flow will help you feel comfortable at the table.

## Turn Order

### Counterclockwise Rotation

Unlike many Western card games, mahjong proceeds **counterclockwise**:

```
        North (北)
           ↑
           |
West (西) ←+→ East (东) [Dealer - starts first]
           |
           ↓
        South (南)
```

**Order:** East → North → West → South → East → ...

### Who Goes First?

**East (the dealer) always goes first.**
- East starts with 14 tiles (everyone else has 13)
- East immediately discards one tile
- Play then proceeds counterclockwise

## Basic Turn Structure

### Your Turn (3 Steps)

Every turn follows this simple pattern:

**1. DRAW** - Take one tile
- Draw from the wall (in front of you or continuing from previous draws)
- Add it to your hand

**2. EVALUATE** - Consider your hand
- Look at your 14 tiles
- Decide what to keep and what to discard
- Think about which tile brings you closer to winning

**3. DISCARD** - Throw one tile
- Choose one tile to discard
- Place it face-up in the center discard area
- Announce the tile (optional, but polite)
- Your turn ends

**Exception:** East's first turn starts at step 2 (already has 14 tiles)

### Complete Turn Example

```
Your hand (13 tiles):
2-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 7-Bam, 8-Bam, 5-Dot, 5-Dot,
3-Wan, 4-Wan, 5-Wan, East, East, West

1. DRAW: You draw 6-Dot from the wall
   Now you have: 14 tiles

2. EVALUATE:
   - You have a complete Chow (2-3-4 Bam)
   - You have an incomplete run (7-8 Bam, missing 6 or 9)
   - You have a Pair (East, East)
   - West is useless (single tile, no matches)
   - 6-Dot doesn't help much

3. DISCARD: You discard West
   Now you have: 13 tiles again

Turn ends, play passes to next player (counterclockwise)
```

## Interrupting Turns (Calling Tiles)

Here's where mahjong gets interesting: **you can claim discarded tiles** to form sets!

### Call Priority (Most to Least Important)

When someone discards a tile, players can interrupt the normal turn order:

1. **Win (Mahjong/Sik)** - Highest priority!
   - Anyone can claim a discard to win
   - If multiple people can win, typically the person closest counterclockwise wins
   - Game ends immediately

2. **Pong** - Claim for a triplet
   - Any player can claim
   - You must have 2 matching tiles
   - Expose all 3 tiles
   - Discard one tile, then play continues to your right

3. **Kong** - Claim for a quad
   - Any player can claim
   - You must have 3 matching tiles
   - Expose all 4 tiles
   - Draw a replacement tile from dead wall
   - Discard one tile, then play continues to your right

4. **Chow (Sheung)** - Claim for a run
   - **Only the next player** (to the right of discarder) can claim
   - You must have 2 tiles that form a run with the discarded tile
   - Expose all 3 tiles
   - Discard one tile, then play continues to your right
   - If someone calls Pong/Kong/Win, Chow is cancelled

### How to Call

**When a tile is discarded:**

1. **Decide immediately** if you want to claim it
2. **Call out** the claim: "Pong!", "Kong!", "Chow!" (or "Sheung!"), or "Mahjong!" (or "Sik!")
3. **Show your tiles** - reveal the matching tiles from your hand
4. **Form the set** - place the complete exposed set face-up in front of you
5. **Discard** - choose a tile to discard (except for Mahjong/Win)
6. **Play continues** from you

**Important:** Once the next player draws, you can no longer claim the previous discard!

### Calling Example

```
Player West discards 7-Dot

You have: 7-Dot, 7-Dot (in your hand)

You call: "Pong!"

You reveal: Both 7-Dots from your hand
You form: 7-Dot, 7-Dot, 7-Dot (exposed set in front of you)
You must discard: One of your remaining tiles
Play continues: From you to the next player

Your hand is now smaller (fewer concealed tiles) but you have a guaranteed set!
```

## Discard Pool

### The Center Area

As players discard, tiles accumulate in the center of the table:

**Organization:**
- Each player's discards typically arranged in rows of 6
- Placed face-up in front of that player's wall section
- Visible to everyone

```
           North's discards
        [6 tiles] [6 tiles] ...

West's    [Center open space]    East's
discards                          discards

        [6 tiles] [6 tiles] ...
           South's discards
```

**Why this matters:**
- You can see what tiles have been discarded
- Helps you determine what's still available
- Shows what other players might be collecting

### Safe vs Dangerous Discards

**Safe tiles** (covered more in Phase 3):
- Tiles that have already been discarded
- Tiles that are very early or very late in play
- Tiles that seem unlikely to complete someone's hand

**Dangerous tiles**:
- Tiles that might complete someone's hand
- Tiles that haven't appeared yet
- Tiles that players seem to be collecting

## Special Tile Events

### Drawing a Flower or Season

When you draw a bonus tile (flower or season):

1. **Reveal it immediately**
2. **Place it face-up** in front of you (separate from hand)
3. **Draw a replacement** from the dead wall
4. **Continue your turn** normally

Bonus tiles don't count toward your 14-tile hand but give you extra points!

### Declaring a Concealed Kong

If you have 4 of the same tile (all in your hand):

1. **Reveal the Kong** on your turn
2. **Place it face-up** (often with 2 face-down to show it was concealed)
3. **Draw a replacement** from the dead wall
4. **Discard normally**
5. **Bonus:** Earn extra points!

### Adding to an Exposed Pong (Small Kong)

If you previously made an exposed Pong (3 tiles) and draw the 4th:

1. **Add the tile** to your exposed Pong
2. **Draw a replacement** from the dead wall
3. **Continue your turn**

**Risk:** This can be "robbed" - if someone needs that tile to win, they can claim it from your Kong!

## End of Hand

### Ways a Hand Can End

**1. Someone Wins**
- Player declares "Mahjong!" or "Sik!"
- Shows their complete hand (4 sets + 1 pair)
- Points are calculated and paid
- Next hand begins

**2. Draw (Wall Exhausted)**
- Live wall runs out (no more tiles to draw)
- No one has won
- Dealer either stays or rotates depending on rules
- Next hand begins

**3. Dead Hand (Rare)**
- Someone has an invalid hand (wrong number of tiles)
- Usually results in penalty
- Hand continues but that player cannot win

## A Complete Hand Walkthrough

Let's watch a simplified example:

**Setup:**
- East (dealer): 14 tiles
- North: 13 tiles
- West: 13 tiles
- South: 13 tiles

**Turn 1 - East:**
- EVALUATE: Looks at 14 tiles
- DISCARD: Discards West Wind
- No one calls it

**Turn 2 - North:**
- DRAW: Draws 5-Bam
- EVALUATE: Now has 5-Bam, 5-Bam, 5-Bam
- DISCARD: Discards 1-Dot
- No one calls it

**Turn 3 - West:**
- DRAW: Draws 7-Wan
- EVALUATE: Doesn't help
- DISCARD: Discards 9-Dot
- SOUTH CALLS: "Pong!" (has 9-Dot, 9-Dot)
- South reveals Pong, discards 2-Bam
- Play continues from South

**Turn 4 - South:** (continues from South since they called)
- DRAW: Draws 4-Wan
- EVALUATE: Completes a Chow with 3-Wan, 5-Wan
- DISCARD: Discards North Wind

**Turn 5 - East:**
- DRAW: Draws Red Dragon
- EVALUATE: Completes their hand! (4 sets + 1 pair)
- DECLARE: "Mahjong!" or "Sik!"
- REVEALS: Shows complete 14-tile hand
- WIN: East wins! Points are calculated.

**Hand ends, next hand begins with same dealer (if dealer won) or dealer rotates.**

## Game Flow Tips

### For Beginners

1. **Don't rush** - Take time to evaluate your hand
2. **Organize your tiles** - Group by suit to see patterns
3. **Watch discards** - Pay attention to what others throw
4. **Start simple** - Don't worry about complex strategy yet
5. **Declare clearly** - Always announce your calls loudly

### Common Mistakes

- ❌ Drawing before the previous player discards
- ❌ Forgetting to discard after drawing
- ❌ Calling too late (after next player draws)
- ❌ Calling Chow when you're not the next player
- ❌ Not revealing bonus tiles immediately
- ❌ Forgetting to draw replacement tiles for Kongs/Flowers

## Rhythm of Play

A typical mahjong hand has a natural rhythm:

**Early game (first ~1/3 of tiles):**
- Players exploring different hand possibilities
- Many discards as people find their direction
- Relatively safe to discard uncommon tiles

**Mid game (middle ~1/3 of tiles):**
- Hands starting to take shape
- More strategic discarding
- Players watching what others collect

**Late game (last ~1/3 of tiles):**
- Some players are ready or close
- Very careful discarding
- High tension as someone might win any turn!

## Practice Exercise

### Simulate a Few Turns

Deal yourself 13 tiles:
1. Draw one tile (now 14)
2. Look for pairs, sets, potential runs
3. Decide what to discard
4. Repeat several times

Get comfortable with the draw-evaluate-discard rhythm!

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the flow:
- Learn the details of [Making Sets](making-sets.md) (when and how to call tiles)
- Understand [Declaring Ready](declaring-ready.md) (when you're close to winning)
- Master [Winning Hands](winning-hands.md) (recognizing when you've won)

---

**Key Takeaway:** Mahjong has a simple, repeating structure. Draw, evaluate, discard. The complexity comes from the decisions you make, not the game flow itself.
