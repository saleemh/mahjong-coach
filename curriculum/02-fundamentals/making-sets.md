# Making Sets

**Phase 2: Core Mechanics - Lesson 2**

Making sets is the heart of mahjong. You need 4 sets + 1 pair to win, and understanding when and how to form these sets - especially when to claim discarded tiles - is crucial to your success.

## Two Ways to Form Sets

### 1. Concealed Sets (Hidden in Your Hand)

**Advantages:**
- Worth more points
- Keeps your hand flexible
- Other players don't know your strategy
- You can win with special patterns

**How they form:**
- Draw the tiles you need naturally from the wall
- Keep them hidden until you win

**Example:**
```
You have: 4-Bam, 5-Bam (in hand)
You draw: 6-Bam (from wall)
Result: Concealed Chow (4-5-6 Bam) - stays in your hand
```

### 2. Exposed Sets (Called/Melded)

**Advantages:**
- Faster to complete
- Guarantee the set (can't be "stolen")
- Can help you win quickly

**Disadvantages:**
- Worth fewer points
- Reveals your strategy
- Locks you into certain patterns
- Restricts some winning hands

**How they form:**
- Claim a discarded tile from another player
- Reveal the matching tiles from your hand
- Place complete set face-up in front of you

## Calling for Pong (Triplet)

### When You Can Call Pong

**Requirements:**
- Someone discards a tile
- You have **exactly 2 matching tiles** in your hand
- **Any player** can call (doesn't matter whose turn it is)

### How to Call Pong

**Process:**
1. Someone discards a tile (example: 7-Dot)
2. You have 7-Dot, 7-Dot in your hand
3. **Immediately call "Pong!"** before next player draws
4. **Reveal your 2 tiles** from your hand
5. **Take the discarded tile**
6. **Arrange the 3 tiles** face-up in front of you
7. **Discard one tile** from your remaining hand
8. **Play continues** from you to the right (counterclockwise)

### Pong Example

```
SITUATION:
Your hand: 2-Bam, 3-Bam, 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan, East, East, Red, Red, Red

Player West discards: 5-Dot

YOUR ACTION:
Call: "Pong!"
Reveal: 5-Dot, 5-Dot (from your hand)
Form exposed set: 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot (face-up in front of you)

Your hand now: 2-Bam, 3-Bam, 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan, East, East, Red, Red, Red (10 tiles)

You must discard: Choose one (e.g., 2-Bam)

Your hand after discard: 3-Bam, 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan, East, East, Red, Red, Red (9 tiles)
+ Exposed: 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot

You now need 4 more tiles to complete your hand!
```

### Showing the Source

The exposed set should indicate where it came from:

**Common convention:**
- Tile from **left opponent**: Turn **leftmost** tile sideways
- Tile from **across opponent**: Turn **middle** tile sideways
- Tile from **right opponent**: Turn **rightmost** tile sideways

```
From player to your left: [5-Dot⟲] [5-Dot] [5-Dot]
From player across:       [5-Dot] [5-Dot⟲] [5-Dot]
From player to your right:[5-Dot] [5-Dot] [5-Dot⟲]

⟲ = turned 90° clockwise
```

This helps others remember the game flow!

## Calling for Kong (Quad)

### Types of Kongs

There are actually **four types** of Kongs:

#### 1. Concealed Kong (暗杠)
**When:** You draw the 4th tile yourself
**Requirements:** All 4 tiles from your hand/draws
**How:** Reveal during your turn, draw replacement, continue

```
Process:
1. You have 4 matching tiles
2. On your turn, declare "Kong!"
3. Reveal all 4 tiles (often 2 face-down, 2 face-up to show it's concealed)
4. Draw a replacement from dead wall
5. Discard normally

Example layout: [3-Bam■] [3-Bam] [3-Bam] [3-Bam■]
(■ = face-down to show concealed)
```

#### 2. Big Exposed Kong (大明杠)
**When:** Someone discards the tile you need for a Kong
**Requirements:** You have 3 matching tiles, someone discards the 4th
**How:** Call "Kong!", reveal your 3, form exposed Kong

```
Process:
1. Someone discards 8-Wan
2. You have 8-Wan, 8-Wan, 8-Wan
3. Call "Kong!"
4. Reveal your 3 tiles
5. Take discarded tile
6. Form exposed Kong (all 4 face-up, mark the called tile)
7. Draw replacement from dead wall
8. Discard normally
```

#### 3. Small Exposed Kong (小明杠)
**When:** You drew the 4th tile after making an exposed Pong
**Requirements:** Previously exposed Pong + you draw the 4th tile
**How:** Add to existing Pong, draw replacement

```
Process:
1. You previously called Pong on 6-Dot (3 tiles exposed)
2. Later, you draw 6-Dot
3. On your turn, add it to the Pong
4. Draw replacement from dead wall
5. Discard normally

⚠️ WARNING: Can be "robbed" if someone needs it to win!
```

#### 4. Robbing the Kong (搶杠)
**When:** Someone declares a small exposed Kong with the tile you need to win
**Requirements:** The Kong tile completes your winning hand
**How:** Declare "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" and take their tile

```
Rare but dramatic!
Someone adds to their Pong to make a Kong
You realize that tile wins your hand
You call "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" and steal it!
```

### Kong Special Rules

**All Kongs:**
- Draw a replacement tile from the dead wall
- Worth bonus points
- Creates an extra tile in your hand temporarily (15 total until you discard)

**Exposed vs Concealed Kongs:**
- Concealed worth more points
- Exposed reveals more information to opponents

## Calling for Chow (Sheung)

### When You Can Call Chow

**Requirements:**
- The player **to your left** (and only that player) discards a tile
- You have **2 tiles that form a sequence** with the discarded tile
- The run must be in a **single suit** (Bamboo, Characters, or Dots)

**Important:** Only the next player in turn order can call Chow!

### How to Call Chow

**Process:**
1. Player to your left discards a tile (example: 5-Wan)
2. You have tiles that can form a run (e.g., 4-Wan and 6-Wan, or 3-Wan and 4-Wan, or 6-Wan and 7-Wan)
3. **Call "Chow!"** (or "Sheung!" in Cantonese)
4. **Reveal your 2 tiles**
5. **Take the discarded tile**
6. **Arrange the 3 tiles** face-up in sequence with the called tile marked
7. **Discard one tile**
8. **Play continues** from you

### Chow Example

```
SITUATION:
Your hand: 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 7-Dot, 7-Dot, 2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan, 6-Wan, 8-Wan, East, Red, Red, Red

Player to your left discards: 7-Wan

YOUR DECISION:
You could make a Chow with 6-Wan, 8-Wan
Call: "Chow!" (or "Sheung!")
Reveal: 6-Wan, 8-Wan
Form exposed set: [6-Wan] [7-Wan⟲] [8-Wan]

Your hand now: 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 7-Dot, 7-Dot, 2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan, East, Red, Red, Red (11 tiles)

You must discard: Choose one (e.g., 3-Bam)
```

### Chow Priority

**Chow has the lowest priority!**

If multiple players want a discarded tile:
1. **Win** beats everything
2. **Pong/Kong** beats Chow
3. **Chow** is last

**Example:**
```
Player A discards 7-Dot

Player B (next player) wants to Chow: 7-Dot for a run
Player C wants to Pong: has 7-Dot, 7-Dot

Player C wins! Pong has priority over Chow.
Player B cannot Chow, play continues from Player C.
```

## Strategic Considerations

### Should You Call or Stay Concealed?

**Call if:**
- You need speed (trying to win quickly)
- The tile is rare or unlikely to appear again
- You're close to winning and need to lock in sets
- You're playing for a low-point fast hand

**Stay concealed if:**
- You're going for high-value patterns
- Your hand is flexible and calling would limit options
- You have time (plenty of tiles in wall)
- You want to hide your strategy

### Exposed Hands Are Faster But Weaker

**Pros of calling:**
- Guaranteed sets (can't lose them)
- Can win in fewer turns
- Less dependent on lucky draws

**Cons of calling:**
- Worth fewer points
- Shows your hand to opponents
- Some special patterns require concealed hands
- Less flexibility

### When NOT to Call

**Don't call if:**
- It makes your hand dead (invalid)
- You already have enough sets
- It exposes too much information
- The points sacrifice isn't worth it
- You'd be calling Chow for a weak hand

**Example of bad call:**
```
Your hand: Almost ready for a high-value "All Pongs" hand
Someone discards a tile you could Chow

Don't call! Chowing would:
- Ruin your "All Pongs" pattern
- Reduce your points significantly
- Expose your strategy
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Can You Call?

**Your hand:** 3-Dot, 3-Dot, 5-Wan, 6-Wan, 7-Bam, 8-Bam

**Scenario A:** Player to your left discards 7-Wan
**Can you call Chow?** Yes! (5-6-7 Wan)

**Scenario B:** Player across from you discards 3-Dot
**Can you call Pong?** Yes! (3-3-3 Dot)

**Scenario C:** Player to your right discards 6-Bam
**Can you call Chow?** No! (Only player to your left can give you Chow)

**Scenario D:** Player to your left discards 6-Bam
**Can you call Chow?** Yes! (6-7-8 Bam or 7-8-9 Bam if you had 9)

### Exercise 2: What Type of Set?

Identify if these are concealed or exposed sets:

**A:** You drew 4-4-4 Wan from the wall over several turns
**Answer:** Concealed Pong

**B:** You called Pong on a discarded 9-Dot
**Answer:** Exposed Pong

**C:** You have Red-Red-Red-Red, all drawn by you
**Answer:** Concealed Kong (if you reveal it)

**D:** You called Chow on 5-Bam (to complete 4-5-6 Bam)
**Answer:** Exposed Chow

### Exercise 3: Should You Call?

**Your hand (13 tiles):**
2-Bam, 2-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Bam, 7-Dot, 7-Dot, 6-Wan, 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan, East, East

**Player to your left discards: 2-Bam**

**Options:**
1. Call Pong (2-2-2 Bam) - Expose a set
2. Pass and hope to draw 1-Bam or 6-Bam for runs

**Analysis:**
- Calling Pong gives you a guaranteed set but exposes information
- You have good potential for runs (3-4-5 Bam, 6-7-8-9 Wan)
- Your hand is quite good already

**Recommendation:** This is a judgment call! For casual play, either option is reasonable. For higher points, staying concealed might be better.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Calling Chow from players other than the one to your left
- ❌ Forgetting to discard after calling
- ❌ Not drawing replacement tile for Kongs
- ❌ Calling when it makes your hand worse
- ❌ Exposing sets unnecessarily early in the game
- ❌ Forgetting that Chow has lowest priority

## Quick Reference Table

| Set Type | Tiles Needed | Who Can Call | Priority | Replacement Tile? |
|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Pong | 3 identical | Anyone | High | No |
| Kong (exposed) | 4 identical | Anyone | High | Yes |
| Kong (concealed) | 4 identical | Only you | - | Yes |
| Chow | 3 consecutive, same suit | Left player only | Low | No |

## Next Steps

Now that you understand making sets:
- Learn about [Declaring Ready](declaring-ready.md) when you're close to winning
- Master [Winning Hands](winning-hands.md) to recognize complete hands

---

**Key Takeaway:** Calling tiles makes hands faster but worth fewer points. Balance speed against value based on your goals!
