# Declaring Ready

**Phase 2: Core Mechanics - Lesson 3**

Being "ready" (聴牌 - tīng pái, or "tenpai" in Japanese) means you're one tile away from winning. Understanding when you're ready - and whether to declare it - is a critical skill in mahjong.

## What Does "Ready" Mean?

### Definition

**Ready = 13 tiles that are one tile away from forming a complete winning hand**

When you have:
- 4 complete or nearly-complete sets
- 1 complete or nearly-complete pair
- Missing exactly 1 tile to win

You are ready!

### Ready vs Not Ready

**Not Ready (12+ tiles away):**
```
Your hand: Random tiles with no clear sets
Example: 1-Bam, 3-Dot, 5-Wan, 7-Bam, East, South, Red, 9-Dot, 2-Wan, 6-Dot, West, 4-Bam, 8-Wan
Status: Far from winning, many tiles needed
```

**Getting Close (5-8 tiles away):**
```
Your hand: Starting to form some sets
Example: 2-Bam, 3-Bam (need 1 or 4), 5-Dot, 5-Dot (need 1 more), 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan (complete!), plus others
Status: Making progress but not ready yet
```

**Ready (1 tile away):**
```
Your hand: 4 sets + 1 tile that needs a pair, OR 3 sets + incomplete set + pair
Example:
Set 1: 2-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam (Chow) ✓
Set 2: 7-Dot, 7-Dot, 7-Dot (Pong) ✓
Set 3: East, East, East (Pong) ✓
Set 4: 5-Wan, 6-Wan (need 4-Wan or 7-Wan)
Pair: 9-Bam, 9-Bam ✓

Waiting for: 4-Wan or 7-Wan
Status: READY!
```

## Types of Waits

Understanding what you're waiting for helps you recognize when you're ready.

### 1. Pair Wait (Tanki)

**Pattern:** Have 1 tile, need its pair for the 14th tile

```
You have: 4 complete sets + 1 tile
Example:
- 2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
- 6-6-6 Dot (Pong)
- 7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
- East-East-East (Pong)
- Red (single tile)

Waiting for: Red Dragon (to complete your pair)
Wait tiles: Just 1 type (Red), but 3 copies remain if none discarded
```

### 2. Edge Wait (Penchan)

**Pattern:** Waiting for 3 or 7 to complete a 1-2 or 8-9 sequence

```
Example A:
You have: 1-Bam, 2-Bam
Waiting for: 3-Bam (only one possibility)

Example B:
You have: 8-Wan, 9-Wan
Waiting for: 7-Wan (only one possibility)
```

**Note:** Can't wait for tiles beyond 9 or before 1 (no wraparound)

### 3. Closed Wait (Kanchan)

**Pattern:** Waiting for the middle tile of a run

```
Example:
You have: 4-Dot, 6-Dot
Waiting for: 5-Dot (fills the gap)

Another:
You have: 2-Wan, 4-Wan
Waiting for: 3-Wan
```

### 4. Two-Sided Wait (Ryanmen) - BEST!

**Pattern:** Waiting for either end of a two-tile sequence

```
Example:
You have: 5-Bam, 6-Bam
Waiting for: 4-Bam OR 7-Bam (two possibilities!)

Another:
You have: 3-Wan, 4-Wan
Waiting for: 2-Wan OR 5-Wan
```

**Why it's best:** Double the chances of drawing your winning tile!

### 5. Three-Tile Wait (Sanmentan)

**Pattern:** Three tiles that can form a run or use one as a pair

```
Example:
You have: 5-Dot, 6-Dot, 7-Dot (plus other complete sets)

This can form:
- 5-6-7 (run) + need another tile for pair
- 5-5 (pair) + 6-7 (waiting for 5 or 8)
- 6-6 (pair) + 5-7 (waiting for 6)
- 7-7 (pair) + 5-6 (waiting for 4 or 7)

Waiting for: Multiple tiles! (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 Dot)
```

**Complex but powerful:** Many winning possibilities!

### 6. Multi-Way Waits

**Pattern:** Multiple incomplete sets create several waiting possibilities

```
Example:
3 complete sets + these tiles: 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Bam, 6-Bam, 7-Bam

Can form:
- 3-4-5 + 6-7 pair (wait for 6)
- 3-4-5 + 6-7-8 need pair
- 3-3 pair + 4-5-6-7 (wait for 3)
- Many other combinations

Waiting for: Several different tiles
```

**Advanced:** As a beginner, don't worry too much about complex waits. Focus on recognizing simple waits first!

## Should You Declare Ready?

In Chinese Classical Mahjong, declaring ready (calling "Ready!" or "Tenpai!") is **optional** and varies by house rules. Some variants:

### Option 1: Secret Ready (Most Common in Chinese Classical)

**Don't announce, just BE ready:**
- You know you're ready but don't tell anyone
- Continue playing normally
- Can still change your wait if you draw useful tiles
- Flexible but requires discipline

**Pros:**
- Keeps your strategy hidden
- Can change your waiting tile
- Opponents don't know you're close

**Cons:**
- You might accidentally break your ready status
- Requires careful attention
- Can be tempting to get greedy and unintentionally go backward

### Option 2: Declared Ready (Riichi - Japanese Style)

**Announce "Ready!" and lock your hand:**
- Declare when ready (usually costs 1000 points)
- Cannot change your hand afterward
- Must discard every drawn tile (autopilot)
- Worth significant bonus points if you win

**Pros:**
- Worth extra points (riichi bonus)
- Shows confidence
- Forces you to commit

**Cons:**
- Costs points to declare
- Locked into your wait
- Opponents know you're ready and will be more careful

**Note:** Traditional Chinese Classical typically doesn't use formal riichi declarations, but some groups adopt it.

### Option 3: No Formal Declaration (Casual Play)

**Just know internally when you're ready:**
- Use it to guide your strategy
- Be careful not to break your ready status
- Win when you draw or catch your tile

**For beginners:** This is the simplest approach for learning!

## Recognizing When You're Ready

### Quick Check Method

**Ask yourself these questions:**

1. **Do I have a pair?** (Or can 1 tile make a pair?)
2. **Do I have 4 sets?** (Or are they almost complete?)
3. **What tile would I need to win?**

If you can answer "Yes, yes, and [specific tile]," you're ready!

### Practice Example 1

```
Your hand (13 tiles):
1-Bam, 2-Bam, 3-Bam    (Chow - complete) ✓
5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot    (Pong - complete) ✓
7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan    (Chow - complete) ✓
East, East, East       (Pong - complete) ✓
Red                    (Pair - incomplete) ✗

Are you ready? YES!
Waiting for: Red Dragon
Wait type: Pair wait
```

### Practice Example 2

```
Your hand (13 tiles):
2-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam    (Chow - complete) ✓
6-Dot, 6-Dot           (Pair - complete) ✓
3-Wan, 4-Wan, 5-Wan    (Chow - complete) ✓
7-Wan, 8-Wan           (Incomplete run) ✗
West, West, West       (Pong - complete) ✓

Are you ready? YES!
Waiting for: 6-Wan or 9-Wan (to complete 7-8 run)
Wait type: Two-sided wait
```

### Practice Example 3

```
Your hand (13 tiles):
3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Bam    (Chow - complete) ✓
7-Dot, 7-Dot           (Incomplete pong) ✗
2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan    (Chow - complete) ✓
8-Wan, 9-Wan           (Incomplete run) ✗
East, East             (Pair - complete) ✓

Are you ready? NO!
Why: You need 2 more tiles (7-Dot for pong AND 7-Wan for run)
```

## Strategy When Ready

### Do's When Ready

✓ **Be patient** - Wait for your tile
✓ **Discard safely** - Avoid giving others winning tiles
✓ **Watch discards** - Track if your waiting tile has been discarded
✓ **Stay calm** - Don't reveal your ready status through behavior
✓ **Pay attention** - Don't miss your winning tile!

### Don'ts When Ready

✗ **Don't break your wait** - Avoid discarding tiles that ruin your ready status
✗ **Don't be greedy** - Resist the urge to go for a "better" hand
✗ **Don't announce** (unless your rules require it)
✗ **Don't panic** - Your tile might still come

### When to Change Your Wait

Sometimes it's smart to intentionally break ready to pursue a better hand:

**Change if:**
- You can switch to a better wait (edge → two-sided)
- You can improve point value significantly
- Your current wait tiles are mostly discarded already
- You drew a tile that opens up a higher-scoring pattern

**Don't change if:**
- You're already on a good two-sided wait
- Many wait tiles are still available
- Game is getting late (fewer tiles left)
- Your hand is already decent value

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- ❌ Not realizing you're ready (missing the win!)
- ❌ Breaking ready accidentally by discarding the wrong tile
- ❌ Waiting on tiles that have all been discarded
- ❌ Getting greedy and trying to improve an already-ready hand
- ❌ Declaring win when you're actually NOT ready (invalid hand)
- ❌ Forgetting to check if you could win on a discarded tile

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Are You Ready?

**Hand A:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
East-East (Pair)
Red-Red-Red (Pong)
```
**Answer:** NO - You have 5 sets and a pair = 17 tiles (too many!)

**Hand B:**
```
1-2-3 Bam (Chow)
4-4 Dot (Pair)
6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
9-9-9 Wan (Pong)
South-South (Incomplete)
```
**Answer:** YES - Ready! Waiting for South

**Hand C:**
```
3-4-5 Bam (Chow)
7-7-7 Dot (Pong)
2-3 Wan (Incomplete)
8-9 Wan (Incomplete)
East-East (Pair)
```
**Answer:** NO - Need 2 tiles (one for each incomplete run)

### Exercise 2: What's Your Wait?

**Hand:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
6-6-6 Dot (Pong)
8-9 Wan (Incomplete)
East-East-East (Pong)
Red-Red (Pair)
```

**Answer:** Waiting for 7-Wan (closed wait)

### Exercise 3: Should You Change?

**Scenario:**
You're ready, waiting for 3-Bam (edge wait on 1-2 Bam)
You draw 4-Bam
If you discard 1-Bam, you'd be waiting for 5-Bam (two-sided wait on 3-4)

**Should you change your wait?**

**Analysis:**
- Current: Edge wait (only 3-Bam works)
- Potential: Two-sided wait (4-Bam or 5-Bam works)
- Trade-off: Lose current ready to get better wait

**Recommendation:** Generally YES - two-sided waits are much better!
