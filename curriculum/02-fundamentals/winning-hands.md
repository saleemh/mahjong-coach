# Winning Hands

**Phase 2: Core Mechanics - Lesson 4**

You know what you're trying to achieve (4 sets + 1 pair), you understand the game flow, you can make sets, and you recognize when you're ready. Now let's master the moment of victory: recognizing and declaring a winning hand!

## Valid Winning Hand Requirements

### The Basic Formula (Review)

**Standard Win:**
```
4 Sets + 1 Pair = 14 tiles

Sets can be:
- Pong (triplet): 3 identical
- Kong (quad): 4 identical (counts as 1 set)
- Chow (run): 3 consecutive, same suit

Pair: 2 identical tiles
```

### The 14-Tile Rule

**Critical:** Your winning hand must have exactly 14 tiles total:
- 13 tiles in your hand when it's your turn
- Draw or claim the 14th tile to win

**With Kongs:**
- A Kong = 4 tiles but counts as 1 set
- Hand with a Kong = 15 tiles total
- Still valid! (4 sets + 1 pair, just one set has 4 tiles)

## Two Ways to Win

### 1. Self-Draw (自摸 - Zì Mō, or "Tsumo")

**You draw your winning tile from the wall**

**Process:**
1. It's your turn
2. You draw a tile from the wall
3. That tile completes your hand (4 sets + 1 pair)
4. Immediately declare: "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" or "Zì Mō!"
5. Reveal your entire hand face-up
6. Demonstrate the 4 sets + 1 pair
7. Calculate points

**Example:**
```
Your hand before draw (13 tiles):
2-3-4 Bam, 5-5-5 Dot, 7-8-9 Wan, East-East-East, Red-Red

You draw: Red Dragon

Your winning hand (14 tiles):
Set 1: 2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
Set 2: 5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
Set 3: 7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
Set 4: East-East-East (Pong)
Pair: Red-Red-Red... wait, that's 3!

Actually: Red-Red (Pair)
Set 4: You need to reorganize...

Let me fix this:
Your hand before draw (13 tiles):
2-3-4 Bam, 5-5-5 Dot, 7-8-9 Wan, East-East, Red-Red-Red

You draw: East

Your winning hand (14 tiles):
Set 1: 2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
Set 2: 5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
Set 3: 7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
Set 4: Red-Red-Red (Pong)
Pair: East-East

Declare: "Mahjong! Self-draw!"
```

**Payment:**
- All three opponents pay you
- Usually worth more points than winning on discard

### 2. Win on Discard (榮和 - Róng Hú, or "Ron")

**Someone discards your winning tile**

**Process:**
1. Someone discards a tile
2. That tile completes your hand
3. Immediately declare: "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" or "Hu!"
4. Claim the discarded tile
5. Reveal your entire hand face-up
6. Demonstrate the 4 sets + 1 pair
7. Calculate points

**Example:**
```
Your hand (13 tiles):
1-2-3 Dot, 4-4-4 Bam, 6-7-8 Wan, South-South-South, 9-9 Wan

Player West discards: 9-Wan

Your action:
1. Immediately call: "Mahjong!" or "Sik!"
2. Claim the 9-Wan
3. Reveal your hand:

Set 1: 1-2-3 Dot (Chow)
Set 2: 4-4-4 Bam (Pong)
Set 3: 6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
Set 4: South-South-South (Pong)
Pair: 9-9-9 Wan... no wait, 9-9 Wan (Pair)

You win!
```

**Payment:**
- Only the discarder pays you (all points)
- Usually worth less than self-draw
- Sometimes called "winning off someone"

## Special Winning Patterns

While most hands follow 4 sets + 1 pair, there are special exceptions:

### Seven Pairs (七対子 - Chī Duì Zi)

**Pattern:** 7 different pairs (no triplets disguised as pairs!)

**Requirements:**
- Exactly 7 pairs
- All pairs must be different
- Cannot include any triplets/quads (e.g., can't have 3-3-3 and count 2 as pairs)

**Example:**
```
1-1 Bam
3-3 Dot
5-5 Wan
7-7 Bam
East-East
Red Dragon-Red Dragon
9-9 Wan

Valid Seven Pairs! ✓
```

**Invalid Seven Pairs:**
```
2-2-2 Bam (this is a triplet, not a pair!)
4-4 Dot
6-6 Wan
8-8 Bam
West-West
Green-Green
1-1 Wan

Invalid - has a triplet ✗
```

**Value:**
- Usually worth special points
- Typically concealed only (can't call tiles)
- Relatively rare and fun to complete!

### Thirteen Orphans (十三幺 - Shí Sān Yāo)

**Pattern:** One each of all terminals and honors + one pair

**Requirements:**
- 1 & 9 of each suit (6 tiles): 1-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Dot, 9-Dot, 1-Wan, 9-Wan
- All winds (4 tiles): East, South, West, North
- All dragons (3 tiles): Red, Green, White
- One duplicate of any of the above (to make 14 total)

**Example:**
```
1-Bam, 9-Bam
1-Dot, 9-Dot
1-Wan, 9-Wan
East, South, West, North
Red, Green, White
White (duplicate)

Valid Thirteen Orphans! ✓
```

**Value:**
- Extremely rare and valuable
- Maximum or near-maximum points
- Usually must be concealed
- Don't worry about this as a beginner!

## Declaring Your Win

### How to Properly Declare

**The moment you complete your hand:**

1. **Immediately announce:**
   - "Mahjong!" (universal)
   - "Sik!" or "Sek!" (Cantonese)
   - "Hu!" (Mandarin)
   - "Zì Mō!" (if self-draw)

2. **Stop all play:**
   - No one else can act
   - Hand is over

3. **Reveal your hand:**
   - Turn all tiles face-up
   - Keep them organized

4. **Demonstrate the structure:**
   - Separate into 4 sets and 1 pair
   - Make it clear and obvious
   - Point out what each group is

5. **Verify it's valid:**
   - Count tiles (should be 14)
   - Ensure all sets are legal
   - Confirm exactly 1 pair

6. **Calculate and record points:**
   - Phase 3 covers scoring in detail
   - For now, just verify it's a valid win

### Verification Checklist

Before declaring, mentally verify:
- [ ] Do I have exactly 14 tiles?
- [ ] Do I have 4 sets?
- [ ] Do I have exactly 1 pair?
- [ ] Are all my sets valid (no mixed-suit runs)?
- [ ] Is this really a winning hand?

**Better to double-check than to incorrectly declare!**

## Multiple Winners (Priority)

### What If Multiple People Can Win?

If more than one person can win on the same discarded tile:

**Priority (most common rules):**
1. **Player order** (counterclockwise from discarder)
2. The player "next in turn order" gets priority

**Example:**
```
East discards 7-Dot

North can win with it
West can win with it
South can win with it

Priority: North (first counterclockwise from East)
```

**Alternative rules:**
- Some groups split the payment
- Some groups give multiple wins (rare in Chinese Classical)
- House rules vary - establish this before playing!

## Invalid Win Declarations (Penalties!)

### Dead Hand / False Win

**If you declare Mahjong but your hand is NOT valid:**

**Consequences (vary by house rules):**
- Pay penalties to all players
- Hand is dead (cannot win this round)
- Lose accumulated points
- Severely frowned upon!

**Common causes:**
- Miscounting tiles (not 14)
- Invalid set (e.g., mixed-suit run)
- Forgot about exposed sets
- Two pairs instead of one
- Math error

**Prevention:**
- Always verify before declaring
- Take your time
- Get comfortable with hand structures

### When You Miss Your Win

**Some rule variants have "sacred discard" (Furiten):**

If you could have won on a tile but passed, you may not be able to win on someone's discard later (but can still self-draw).

**Chinese Classical typically doesn't enforce this strictly in casual play**, but be aware some groups use it.

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Valid or Invalid Win?

**Hand A:**
```
1-2-3 Bam (Chow)
4-5-6 Dot (Chow)
7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
East-East-East (Pong)
South-South (Pair)

Total: 14 tiles
```
**Answer:** ✓ VALID!

**Hand B:**
```
2-2-2 Bam (Pong)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
8-8-8 Wan (Pong)
West-West-West (Pong)
Red-Red-Red (Pong)

Total: 15 tiles
```
**Answer:** ✗ INVALID - 5 sets, no pair (and 15 tiles)

**Hand C:**
```
3-4-5 Bam (Chow)
6-7-8 Dot (Chow)
2-4-6 Wan (???)
East-East-East (Pong)
9-9 Wan (Pair)
```
**Answer:** ✗ INVALID - 2-4-6 Wan is not a valid set (not consecutive)

**Hand D:**
```
1-1 Bam, 2-2 Dot, 3-3 Wan, 4-4 Bam, 5-5 Dot, 6-6 Wan, 7-7 Bam
Total: 14 tiles
```
**Answer:** ✓ VALID Seven Pairs!

### Exercise 2: How Did They Win?

**Scenario A:**
Player has 13 tiles, draws from wall, declares "Mahjong!"
**Answer:** Self-draw

**Scenario B:**
Player has 13 tiles, you discard 5-Dot, they call "Sik!" and reveal their hand
**Answer:** Won on discard (your 5-Dot)

### Exercise 3: Can You Win?

**Your hand (13 tiles):**
```
2-3-4 Bam
6-6-6 Dot
1-2-3 Wan
East-East-East
5-5 Wan
```

**Question 1:** Can you win if you draw 5-Wan?
**Answer:** YES! (5-5 becomes 5-5-5 Pong... wait, let me recount. You have 2-3-4 Bam (3) + 6-6-6 Dot (3) + 1-2-3 Wan (3) + East-East-East (3) + 5-5 Wan (2) = 14 tiles already. So you're already at 14 tiles which means you can't win by drawing. Let me reconsider...)

Actually, if you have 13 tiles:
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow) - 3 tiles
6-6-6 Dot (Pong) - 3 tiles
1-2-3 Wan (Chow) - 3 tiles
East-East (Pair) - 2 tiles
5-5 Wan (Incomplete pair/pong) - 2 tiles
Total: 13 tiles
```

**Question 1:** Can you win if you draw 5-Wan?
**Answer:** NO - You'd have 3 pairs (East-East, 5-5-5 as triplet, wait that works!)
Actually: 2-3-4 Bam, 6-6-6 Dot, 1-2-3 Wan, 5-5-5 Wan (Pong), East-East (Pair) = ✓ YES, you win!

**Question 2:** Can you win if you draw East?
**Answer:** YES! 2-3-4 Bam, 6-6-6 Dot, 1-2-3 Wan, East-East-East (Pong), 5-5 Wan (Pair) = ✓ YES!

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Declaring win when not actually complete
- ❌ Forgetting about exposed sets when calculating
- ❌ Not verifying the hand structure before declaring
- ❌ Missing that you've won!
- ❌ Declaring "Mahjong" but having 13 tiles instead of 14
- ❌ Counting a Kong as 2 sets instead of 1

## Congratulations - Phase 2 Complete!

You now understand:
- ✓ How game flow works (draw-evaluate-discard)
- ✓ How to make sets (concealed and exposed)
- ✓ When you're ready (one tile away)
- ✓ How to win (self-draw or on discard)

### You Can Now Play Complete Games!

With this knowledge, you can sit down and play actual mahjong games from start to finish. The next phase (Scoring & Strategy) will help you understand points and make better decisions, but you already have enough to play and enjoy the game!

## Next Steps

**Before moving to Phase 3:**
- Play at least 5-10 complete games
- Focus on recognizing valid hands
- Practice declaring wins correctly
- Get comfortable with the game rhythm

**Ready for more?**
