# Scoring Basics

**Phase 3: Scoring & Strategy - Lesson 2**

Scoring in Chinese Classical Mahjong can range from simple to extremely complex depending on the variant and house rules. This lesson covers the fundamental concepts you need for casual play. Don't worry about memorizing everything - keep scoring charts handy!

## Important Note on Variants

**Chinese Classical Mahjong has many regional scoring systems:**
- Hong Kong Old Style (HK)
- Taiwanese
- Cantonese
- Modern Chinese Official (MCR)
- Simplified house rules

**This guide covers general principles.** Your playing group should agree on specific rules before starting!

## Basic Scoring Concepts

### Points (分 - Fēn) and Doubles (番 - Fān)

**Two-part system:**

**Base Points:**
- Minimum hand value (often 2-10 points)
- Modified by hand composition

**Doubles (Fan):**
- Multipliers from patterns
- Each double multiplies the score
- Stack exponentially: 1 double = ×2, 2 doubles = ×4, 3 doubles = ×8

**Formula:**
```
Final Score = Base Points × 2^(number of doubles)
```

**Example:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 3 (from patterns)
Calculation: 4 × 2³ = 4 × 8 = 32 points
```

### Limit Hands (Yakuman / 役満)

**Maximum scoring hands:**
- Worth the agreed maximum (often 500-1000 points or more)
- Rare and special patterns
- Usually immediate maximum regardless of other calculations

**Examples:**
- Thirteen Orphans
- All Green
- Nine Gates
- Four Concealed Triplets

## Simple Scoring System (For Beginners)

### Option: Fixed Value per Pattern

Many casual groups use simplified scoring:

**Assign point values to patterns:**
```
All Simples: 5 points
Value Tiles (each): 5 points
All Triplets: 10 points
Half Flush: 15 points
Full Flush: 30 points
Seven Pairs: 15 points
etc.
```

**Add them up:**
```
Example hand with:
- All Simples (5 points)
- Red Dragon Pong (5 points)
- Self-draw bonus (5 points)

Total: 15 points
```

**Payment:**
- Winner receives total from loser(s)
- Self-draw: all three players pay
- Win on discard: discarder pays all

This system is easy for beginners and casual play!

## Traditional Doubles System

### Common Doubles (Fan)

**1 Double:**
- All Simples
- No Honors (all suited tiles)
- Value Tile (each dragon or wind Pong)
- Concealed Hand (if self-draw with no calls)
- All Chows
- One-Suit + Honors (Half Flush) - sometimes 2-3 doubles

**2 Doubles:**
- All Triplets
- Three Concealed Triplets
- All Terminals & Honors (all 1s, 9s, winds, dragons)
- Seven Pairs

**3 Doubles:**
- Half Flush (in some systems)
- Small Dragons (2 Dragon Pongs + 1 Dragon Pair)

**5-6 Doubles (often limit):**
- Full Flush
- Big Dragons (all 3 Dragon Pongs)

**Limit (maximum):**
- Thirteen Orphans
- All Green
- Four Concealed Triplets
- Nine Gates

### Bonus Doubles

**Additional multipliers:**

**Flowers/Seasons:**
- Own flower: +1 double
- All 4 flowers: +1 double
- All 4 seasons: +1 double

**Kong:**
- Each Kong: +1 double (some systems)

**Self-draw:**
- Win by self-draw: +1 double (some systems)

**Last Tile:**
- Win on last tile from wall: +1 double

**Robbing a Kong:**
- Win by stealing a Kong: +1 double

## Payment Structures

### Who Pays What?

**Self-Draw (自摸):**
- All three opponents pay the winner
- Sometimes dealer pays double

**Example:**
```
Your winning hand: 32 points
Payment:
- Each player pays you 32 points
- You receive: 32 × 3 = 96 points total
```

**Win on Discard:**
- Only the discarder pays
- Pays the full amount

**Example:**
```
Your winning hand: 32 points
Player West discarded your winning tile
Payment:
- West pays you 32 points (or sometimes 32 × 3 = 96)
- Other players pay nothing
```

**Dealer Bonuses:**
- Dealer wins typically score higher (1.5× or 2×)
- Dealer loses typically pay more
- Exact multipliers vary by rules

## Sample Scoring Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Hand

**Your hand:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
3-4-5 Dot (Chow)
7-7 Bam (Pair)
```

**Patterns:**
- All Simples (all tiles 2-8): 1 double
- Concealed hand: 1 double (if applicable)

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 2
Score: 4 × 2² = 4 × 4 = 16 points
```

### Scenario 2: Value Hand

**Your hand:**
```
1-2-3 Bam (Chow)
Red-Red-Red (Dragon Pong)
East-East-East (Wind Pong - you are East, round is East)
6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
5-5 Dot (Pair)
```

**Patterns:**
- Red Dragon: 1 double
- Seat Wind (East): 1 double
- Round Wind (East): 1 double (same Pong counts for both!)
- Total: 3 doubles

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 3
Score: 4 × 2³ = 4 × 8 = 32 points
```

### Scenario 3: High Value Hand

**Your hand (all Bamboo + Dragon):**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
5-6-7 Bam (Chow)
8-8-8 Bam (Pong)
Green-Green-Green (Dragon)
6-6 Bam (Pair)
```

**Patterns:**
- Half Flush (one suit + honors): 3 doubles
- Green Dragon: 1 double
- Total: 4 doubles

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 4
Score: 4 × 2⁴ = 4 × 16 = 64 points
```

## Practical Scoring Tips

### For Casual Play

1. **Use a scoring chart** - Keep one handy, don't memorize
2. **Agree on rules beforehand** - Avoid arguments later
3. **Start simple** - Use fixed point values per pattern
4. **Use a calculator** - No shame in math help!
5. **Focus on playing** - Don't let scoring slow down the game

### Common Simplifications

**Beginner-friendly scoring:**
- Fixed values instead of doubles
- Limit maximum score (e.g., 50 or 100 points)
- Self-draw = discarder pays same amount
- Ignore flower/season bonuses
- No dealer multipliers

### Scoring Sheet Template

Keep a running score:
```
| Round | East | South | West | North |
|-------|------|-------|------|-------|
| E1    | +32  | -12   | -10  | -10   |
| E2    | -15  | +45   | -15  | -15   |
| ...   | ...  | ...   | ...  | ...   |
| TOTAL | 150  | 200   | 75   | 125   |
```

## Scoring Disputes

**How to avoid:**
- Agree on variant before playing
- Use a reference chart
- Have one person be the scorer
- When in doubt, simplify

**If you disagree:**
- Replay the hand (rare)
- Majority vote
- Use house rules
- Keep it friendly!

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Calculate the Score

**Hand:**
```
3-4-5 Bam, 6-6-6 Dot, 2-3-4 Wan, 7-7-7 Wan, 5-5 Bam
Patterns: All Simples (1 double)
Base: 4 points
```

**Answer:** 4 × 2¹ = 8 points

### Exercise 2: Identify Doubles

**Hand:**
```
1-1-1 Bam, 9-9-9 Dot, East-East-East, 1-1-1 Wan, 9-9 Bam
```

**Patterns:**
- All Terminals & Honors: 2 doubles
- All Triplets: 2 doubles
- Total: 4 doubles

**Score:** 4 × 2⁴ = 64 points

## Quick Reference

**Doubling Progression:**
```
0 doubles: ×1 (base)
1 double: ×2
2 doubles: ×4
3 doubles: ×8
4 doubles: ×16
5 doubles: ×32 (often limit)
6+ doubles: Usually limit hand
```

**Common Limits:**
- 5 doubles = 32× base (often maximum)
- Special hands = automatic limit
- Typical limit: 500-1000 points
