# Reading the Table

**Phase 3: Scoring & Strategy - Lesson 4**

Reading the table means understanding what your opponents are doing by observing their discards, calls, and exposed sets. This skill transforms mahjong from a solo tile-matching game into a strategic, interactive competition.

## What You Can Observe

### Visible Information

**You can see:**
1. **All discarded tiles** - What everyone has thrown away
2. **Exposed sets** - Pongs, Kongs, Chows that players have called
3. **Timing of discards** - Order matters (early vs. late)
4. **Hesitation or speed** - How quickly players discard
5. **Flowers and seasons** - Bonus tiles revealed

**You cannot see:**
- Tiles in players' hands
- Exactly what they're waiting for
- Their complete strategy

**Your job:** Make educated guesses based on visible information!

## Reading Discards

### Pattern Recognition

**All of one suit discarded:**
```
Player A discards: 1-Bam, 3-Bam, 5-Bam, 7-Bam, 9-Bam

Analysis:
→ They're NOT collecting Bamboo
→ Likely going for Character/Dot flush or mixed patterns
→ Bamboo is relatively safe against them
→ Other suits are DANGEROUS
```

**No honors discarded:**
```
Player B discards: 2-Wan, 5-Dot, 8-Bam, 3-Wan, 6-Dot
(All suited tiles, zero honors)

Analysis:
→ They might be collecting honors
→ Going for All Honors or specific winds/dragons
→ Honor tiles are DANGEROUS against them
```

**Only terminals discarded:**
```
Player C discards: 1-Wan, 9-Dot, 1-Bam, 9-Wan

Analysis:
→ Pursuing All Simples (no 1s or 9s)
→ Middle tiles (2-8) are dangerous
→ More terminals are relatively safe
```

**Mixed, scattered discards:**
```
Player D discards: 3-Bam, East, 7-Dot, 2-Wan, South, 9-Bam

Analysis:
→ Still exploring, no clear pattern
→ Hand probably not very developed
→ Stay generally cautious but no specific danger
```

## Reading Exposed Sets

### What Calls Tell You

**Early Pong calls:**
```
Round just started, Player A calls Pong on 7-7-7 Dot

Analysis:
→ They're committing to triplets (possibly All Triplets)
→ They won't be going for All Chows patterns
→ They're playing aggressively (exposing early)
→ Watch for more Pongs - could be All Triplets
```

**Multiple Chow calls from one suit:**
```
Player B has exposed:
- 2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
- 5-6-7 Wan (Chow)

Analysis:
→ Definitely pursuing Wan flush (Full or Half Flush)
→ ALL Wan tiles are dangerous!
→ They're close to winning (2 sets already)
→ Be very careful with Wan discards
```

**Dragon Pong exposed:**
```
Player C exposes: Red-Red-Red (Dragon Pong)

Analysis:
→ At least 1 double secured (value tile)
→ Might be going for multiple dragons
→ Watch for other dragon collections
→ Red Dragon is now absolutely safe (can't wait for 4th)
```

**Wind Pongs:**
```
Player D (sitting in East position) exposes: East-East-East

Analysis:
→ Worth double points (seat wind + possibly round wind)
→ They're building value into their hand
→ East is safe to discard (they have all 3 visible)
```

## Reading Hand Development Stage

### Early Stage Indicators

**Many discards, no calls:**
```
Player has 8-10 discards, hasn't called anything

Analysis:
→ Still developing hand
→ Probably not close to winning
→ Might be going for concealed patterns
→ Moderate threat level
```

**Quick calls on everything:**
```
Player has already called 2 Pongs and 1 Chow

Analysis:
→ Very aggressive, going for speed
→ Likely close to winning (3/4 sets done!)
→ HIGH threat level
→ Their hand is exposed (worth fewer points but faster)
```

### Mid-Late Stage Indicators

**Slowed discarding:**
```
Player takes longer to decide each discard

Analysis:
→ Probably ready or close to ready
→ Carefully considering safety vs. improving
→ HIGH threat level
→ Be very defensive against them
```

**Confident, quick discards:**
```
Player discards immediately without hesitation

Analysis:
→ Either very far from winning OR
→ Already ready and just passing turns
→ Watch their pattern to determine which
```

## Recognizing When Someone Is Ready

### Danger Signs

**1. Defensive discarding:**
```
Player starts discarding only previously-discarded tiles

Analysis:
→ They're ready!
→ Playing defensively, waiting for their tile
→ Don't discard anything new!
```

**2. Changed discard pattern:**
```
Player was discarding Bamboo, suddenly stops and discards honors

Analysis:
→ They completed their Bamboo sets
→ Now cleaning up useless honors
→ Likely ready or very close
```

**3. No calls despite good opportunities:**
```
Player could have Ponged 6-Dot but passed

Analysis:
→ Either already have that set complete, OR
→ Hand is concealed and going for higher value
→ Treat as potential threat
```

**4. Exposed three sets already:**
```
Player has 3 visible sets

Analysis:
→ Only need 1 more set + pair to win!
→ VERY dangerous, assume they're ready
→ Maximum defensive play
```

## Reading Player Types

### Aggressive Players

**Characteristics:**
- Call frequently
- Expose sets early
- Go for speed over value
- Take risks

**How to counter:**
- Play defensively
- Don't feed them tiles
- Let them burn through their opportunities
- Be patient

### Conservative Players

**Characteristics:**
- Rarely call
- Keep hands concealed
- Go for high-value patterns
- Play slowly

**How to counter:**
- Apply pressure with speed
- Watch for their pattern development
- They're vulnerable to fast aggressive play
- Don't let them complete expensive hands

### Unpredictable Players

**Characteristics:**
- Inconsistent strategy
- Mix of calls and passes
- Hard to read

**How to counter:**
- General defensive play
- Watch each hand independently
- Don't assume patterns
- Stay flexible

## Table Position Awareness

### Relative Position Matters

**Player to your right (feeds you Chow):**
- Their discards you can call for runs
- Pay special attention to their throws
- If they're dangerous, you have an advantage (first claim)

**Player to your left:**
- You cannot Chow their discards
- Watch what they're collecting
- Less direct threat for your Chow opportunities

**Player across:**
- Equal distance from everyone
- Observe for general table reading
- Pong opportunities equal for all

## Practical Table Reading

### Example Situation

**Round in progress:**

**Player East:**
- Discards: 1-Bam, 9-Dot, West, North, 1-Wan
- Exposed: None
- Analysis: Likely All Simples, no pattern yet, low threat

**Player North (you):**
- Your hand: Developing Half Flush in Dots
- Ready in: 4-5 more tiles

**Player West:**
- Discards: All Bamboo and Characters
- Exposed: 3-4-5 Dot (Chow), 7-7-7 Dot (Pong)
- Analysis: DEFINITELY Dot flush! HIGH DANGER!

**Player South:**
- Discards: Mixed tiles
- Exposed: Red-Red-Red (Pong)
- Analysis: Going for value, has Dragon, moderate threat

**Your strategy:**
- ABORT Dot flush (West has it)
- Pivot to different pattern or speed win
- Don't discard Dots to West
- General caution against South's developing hand

## Advanced Observations

### Tile Counting

**Track common tiles:**
```
Mental count of 5-Dot:
- You have: 1
- Discarded: 2 visible
- Remaining in game: 1

Conclusion: Last 5-Dot is valuable or impossible to get
```

### Yaku Elimination

**If you see:**
```
Player has exposed Chow + exposed Pong

Analysis:
→ Can't be going for All Chows
→ Can't be going for All Triplets
→ Narrows down possibilities
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: What's the Pattern?

**Player discards (in order):** East, West, North, South, 1-Bam, 9-Wan, 1-Dot

**What are they doing?**

**Answer:** Discarding all honors and terminals → Going for All Simples

### Exercise 2: Threat Level?

**Player has exposed:**
- 2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
- 6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
- 9-9-9 Wan (Pong)

**How dangerous are they?**

**Answer:** VERY dangerous!
- 3 sets already visible
- All in Wan (likely flush)
- Only need 1 set + pair to win
- Maximum caution!

### Exercise 3: Safe Discard?

**Situation:**
- Player A exposed: 5-5-5 Bam
- Player B discarded: 6-Bam earlier
- You have: 6-Bam, 7-Bam

**Is 6-Bam safe to discard?**

**Answer:**
- Against Player A: Unknown (could be waiting for 6-Bam for run)
- Against Player B: Absolutely safe (they discarded it)
- Overall: Relatively safe but not guaranteed

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Not watching discards at all (playing in isolation)
- ❌ Only watching your own hand
- ❌ Forgetting what was discarded early
- ❌ Not noticing when patterns emerge
- ❌ Ignoring exposed sets
- ❌ Assuming everyone plays the same way

## Integration with Other Skills

- Adjust discards based on observations

**Reading + Hand Building:**
- Change your strategy if someone has your pattern
- Adapt to table dynamics

**Reading + Scoring:**
- Estimate opponent hand values
- Decide if defensive play is worth it
