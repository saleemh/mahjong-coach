# Strategic Discards

**Phase 3: Scoring & Strategy - Lesson 3**

What you discard is just as important as what you keep. Strategic discarding is the art of throwing away tiles that don't help you while avoiding tiles that help opponents. This skill separates beginners from intermediate players.

## The Golden Rule

**Never discard a tile that completes someone's winning hand if you can avoid it!**

Easier said than done, but this is your primary goal when discarding.

## Basic Discard Priority

### Early Game (First 1/3 of Tiles)

**Safest to discard:**
1. **Honors you don't have pairs of** (especially winds)
2. **Extreme terminals** (1s and 9s if you don't have sequences starting/ending with them)
3. **Isolated tiles** (no neighboring tiles in the same suit)
4. **Tiles from suits you're not pursuing**

**Example early discard order:**
```
Your hand:
1-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 7-Wan, 8-Wan, East, West, North, Red, 9-Dot, 2-Wan

Discard priority:
1. West (isolated honor, no pair)
2. North (isolated honor, no pair)
3. 1-Bam (terminal, no 2-Bam to make run)
4. 9-Dot (terminal, isolated)
```

### Mid Game (Middle 1/3 of Tiles)

**More strategic discards:**
1. **Tiles that break up your hand least**
2. **Tiles that others have already discarded** (safer)
3. **Tiles that don't fit your developing pattern**
4. **Safe tiles** (tiles unlikely to be winning tiles)

**Start avoiding:**
- Tiles no one has discarded yet
- Middle tiles (4-6) that others might be collecting
- Tiles that match patterns you see in exposed sets

### Late Game (Last 1/3 of Tiles)

**Maximum caution:**
1. **Only discard tiles you've seen discarded before**
2. **Genbutsu** (absolutely safe tiles - explained below)
3. **Tiles that can't possibly complete common waits**

**Danger signals:**
- Someone hasn't discarded honors → they might be collecting them
- Someone discarding one suit → they're going for flush in another
- Someone has many exposed sets → they're close to winning

## Safe Tiles (Genbutsu / 現物)

### Absolutely Safe Tiles

**Tiles that CANNOT complete someone's winning hand:**

**1. Tiles already discarded by that player**
```
If Player A discarded 5-Dot earlier, they cannot be waiting for 5-Dot
→ 5-Dot is absolutely safe to discard (against Player A)
```

**Note:** Only safe against that specific player!

**2. Tiles you see in their exposed sets**
```
Player B has exposed: 6-6-6 Wan
They cannot be waiting for 6-Wan
→ 6-Wan is safe to discard (against Player B)
```

**3. Fourth copy of a tile**
```
Three 8-Dots are visible (exposed or discarded)
You have the fourth 8-Dot
→ No one can be waiting for 8-Dot (there aren't any left!)
```

### Relatively Safe Tiles

**Tiles that are probably safe:**

**1. Tiles discarded by multiple players**
```
2-Bam has been discarded by Players A, B, and C
→ Probably safe, unlikely anyone is collecting it
```

**2. Honors in late game**
```
Late game, East has been discarded twice
→ Probably safe (most players would have collected Pongs early)
```

**3. Terminals after middle-game**
```
No one has called runs with 1-2-3 or 7-8-9
→ 1s and 9s become safer
```

## Dangerous Tiles

### Most Dangerous Tiles

**1. Tiles no one has discarded**
```
It's late game, no one has discarded Red Dragon
→ DANGEROUS! Someone might be waiting for it
```

**2. Tiles near exposed sequences**
```
Player A has exposed: 4-5-6 Bam
→ 3-Bam and 7-Bam are dangerous (they might be waiting for these)
```

**3. Middle tiles (4-5-6) in late game**
```
Mid-game and beyond: 4s, 5s, 6s are most dangerous
→ They form the most flexible runs
```

**4. Tiles matching the pattern of discards**
```
Player B has discarded: all Bamboo, all Characters, keeping only Dots
→ Dots are VERY dangerous against Player B (they're going for flush)
```

## Reading Discard Patterns

### What Discards Tell You

**Fast discard of one suit:**
```
Player discards: 1-Bam, 3-Bam, 7-Bam, 9-Bam all early
→ They're NOT collecting Bamboo
→ Other suits are dangerous
```

**Keeping all honors:**
```
Player has discarded only suited tiles, zero honors
→ They might be collecting All Honors or specific wind/dragon sets
→ Honors are dangerous
```

**Only terminals discarded:**
```
Player discards: 1-Wan, 9-Dot, 1-Bam, 9-Wan
→ They're going for All Simples
→ 2-8 tiles are dangerous
```

**Scattered discards:**
```
Player discards tiles from all suits randomly
→ They haven't committed to a pattern yet
→ Stay flexible but cautious
```

## Strategic Discard Situations

### Situation 1: You Have a Choice

**Your hand is ready, waiting for 5-Dot:**
```
You draw: 3-Wan (useless to you)
Your other useless tile: 7-Bam

Which to discard?
```

**Analysis:**
- Check which tile has been discarded more
- Check if 3-Wan or 7-Bam appears in exposed sets
- If equal safety, discard the tile from the suit you have least of

**Decision:** If three 3-Wans have been discarded but only one 7-Bam, discard 3-Wan (safer).

### Situation 2: Defensive vs. Offensive

**Late game, you're not ready yet:**

**Option A (Offensive):** Discard to improve your hand (risky)
**Option B (Defensive):** Discard safe tiles only (slower)

**When to be defensive:**
- Someone looks close to winning
- You're behind in points
- It's late and you're unlikely to win anyway

**When to be offensive:**
- You're close to winning yourself
- No clear danger signals
- You need this win for the game

### Situation 3: Calling vs. Safety

**Someone discards a tile you can Pong:**

**Consider:**
- Does calling expose your strategy?
- Does it commit you to a pattern?
- Are you giving away information that helps opponents?

**Sometimes it's better to pass and stay concealed!**

## Discard Organization

### How to Organize Discards

**Standard convention:**
```
Your discards in front of you:
Row 1: [6 tiles]
Row 2: [6 tiles]
Row 3: [6 tiles]
...

Left to right, row by row shows order
```

**Why organization matters:**
- Others can see what you discarded when
- Early vs. late discards give different information
- Helps everyone track the game

### Reading Others' Discard Order

**Early discards:** Less significant (just cleaning hand)
**Middle discards:** Show what they're NOT pursuing
**Late discards:** Show what they CAN'T use (very informative!)

**Example:**
```
Player A's discards:
Early: West, North, 1-Bam, 9-Wan (cleaning)
Middle: 3-Dot, 5-Dot, 7-Dot (not pursuing Dots)
Late: 2-Wan, 4-Wan (can't use these Wans either)

Conclusion: They're likely collecting Bamboo, possibly with honors
→ Be very careful discarding Bamboo tiles!
```

## Common Discard Mistakes

**❌ Discarding tiles others are clearly collecting**
```
Player B has Pong of 6-6-6 Bam exposed
You discard 5-Bam (dangerous! Could complete 4-5-6 or 5-6-7 run)
```

**❌ Not tracking what's safe**
```
Late game, you discard 8-Dot without checking
Player C declares Mahjong (was waiting for 8-Dot!)
```

**❌ Breaking up good waits**
```
You have 4-5 Wan (waiting for 3 or 6)
You discard 4-Wan to "simplify"
Now you only have 5-Wan (useless alone)
```

**❌ Being too defensive**
```
You only discard safe tiles, never improve your hand
Game ends in draw, you never had a chance to win
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: What's Safe?

**Situation:**
- Player A discarded: 2-Bam, 5-Dot, East, 9-Wan
- Player A exposed: 7-7-7 Wan (Pong)
- You have: 7-Wan, 2-Bam, 6-Dot

**Which is safest to discard (against Player A)?**

**Answer:**
- 7-Wan is absolutely safe (they have a Pong already, can't wait for 4th)
- 2-Bam is absolutely safe (they discarded it)
- 6-Dot is unknown

**Discard 7-Wan or 2-Bam**

### Exercise 2: Reading the Pattern

**Player B's discards (in order):**
1-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Dot, 9-Dot, East, West, North

**What pattern are they pursuing?**

**Answer:** Likely All Simples (discarding all terminals and winds)
→ Be cautious with 2-8 tiles!

### Exercise 3: Make Your Choice

**Your hand (ready, waiting for 3-Bam):**
```
Sets complete, two useless tiles: 8-Dot, 5-Wan
```

**Situation:**
- 8-Dot has been discarded 3 times
- 5-Wan has been discarded 1 time
- One player has exposed 4-5-6 Wan

**Which to discard?**

**Answer:** 8-Dot (much safer - discarded more, and the 4-5-6 Wan set makes 5-Wan potentially dangerous)

## Advanced Tips

1. **Count tiles mentally** - Track how many of each are visible
2. **Watch timing** - Early vs. late discards mean different things
3. **Observe reactions** - Players might hesitate before dangerous discards
4. **Balance risk and reward** - Sometimes risky discards are necessary
5. **Stay flexible** - Don't be too rigid with patterns if tiles aren't coming

**Key Takeaway:** Smart discarding is about minimizing risk to others while maximizing your own progress. When in doubt, discard safe!
