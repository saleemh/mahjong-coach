# Common Hand Patterns

**Phase 3: Scoring & Strategy - Lesson 1**

Now that you can play complete games, let's learn about hand patterns (役 - yaku in Japanese, 番 - fān in Chinese). These patterns make your winning hands worth more points. Recognizing and pursuing valuable patterns is what separates casual players from strategic players.

## Why Patterns Matter

**Basic principle:**
- A minimal valid hand (4 sets + 1 pair) has a base value
- Each special pattern multiplies your points
- Multiple patterns can combine for huge scores
- Some patterns are easy, others are rare and valuable

**Strategy:**
- Sometimes go for simple, fast hands
- Sometimes pursue valuable patterns
- Balance speed vs. value based on the situation

## Pattern Categories

Patterns are generally classified by difficulty and value:

**1-2 Points (番):** Common, achievable, good targets
**3-4 Points:** Harder, valuable, worth pursuing
**5+ Points:** Rare, very valuable, limit hands
**Special:** Unique patterns with maximum value

## Easy Patterns (1-2 Points)

These are achievable in most games and good foundations for beginners.

### All Simples (Tanyao / 断幺九)

**Pattern:** No terminals (1s/9s) or honors - only 2-8 of suits

**Requirements:**
- All tiles must be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8
- From Bamboo, Characters, or Dots
- No winds, no dragons, no 1s or 9s

**Example:**
```
3-4-5 Bam (Chow)
6-6-6 Dot (Pong)
2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
7-7-7 Bam (Pong)
5-5 Dot (Pair)

All tiles are 2-8 ✓
Value: 1 point
```

**Strategy:**
- Easiest pattern to achieve
- Very flexible (middle tiles are common)
- Great for fast hands
- Often combined with other patterns

### All Runs (Pinfu / 平和)

**Pattern:** All Chows (runs), no Pongs/Kongs, specific pair wait

**Requirements:**
- 4 Chows (no Pongs or Kongs)
- Pair that's NOT your seat wind, round wind, or dragons
- Two-sided wait (not edge, closed, or pair wait)
- Must be concealed (cannot call tiles)

**Example:**
```
1-2-3 Bam (Chow)
4-5-6 Dot (Chow)
2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
5-5 Dot (Pair - not wind/dragon)

Waiting on: 4-5 of something for two-sided wait
Value: 1 point
Bonus: If self-drawn, worth more
```

**Strategy:**
- Peaceful, smooth hand (that's what "Pinfu" means)
- Requires discipline (can't call Pongs)
- Worth less but elegant
- Good for building speed

### Value Tiles (役牌 - Yakuhai)

**Pattern:** Pong/Kong of dragons or your winds

**Requirements:**
Pong (or Kong) of:
- Any dragon (Red, Green, White) = 1 point each
- Round wind = 1 point
- Your seat wind = 1 point

**Note:** These stack!

**Example 1:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
Red-Red-Red (Pong) ← Dragon!
5-6-7 Dot (Chow)
7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
9-9 Bam (Pair)

Value: 1 point (dragon)
```

**Example 2 (Stacking):**
```
You are East (seat), round is East

3-4-5 Bam (Chow)
East-East-East (Pong) ← Your seat wind AND round wind!
6-7-8 Dot (Chow)
2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
5-5 Wan (Pair)

Value: 2 points (1 for seat wind + 1 for round wind from same Pong!)
```

**Strategy:**
- Easy to incorporate
- Winds are tricky (need to know seat and round)
- Dragons are straightforward
- Can boost a simple hand's value

## Medium Patterns (2-3 Points)

Harder to achieve but significantly more valuable.

### All Triplets (Toitoi / 対々和)

**Pattern:** All Pongs/Kongs, no Chows

**Requirements:**
- 4 Pongs or Kongs
- No Chows allowed
- Pair

**Example:**
```
3-3-3 Bam (Pong)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
7-7-7-7 Wan (Kong)
East-East-East (Pong)
9-9 Bam (Pair)

Value: 2 points
```

**Strategy:**
- Harder to complete (need matching tiles)
- Can call Pongs to speed it up (but worth less if exposed)
- Powerful and satisfying
- Watch for other players collecting same tiles

### Three Concealed Triplets (San Ankou / 三暗刻)

**Pattern:** Three Pongs in your hand (concealed, not called)

**Requirements:**
- 3 Pongs that you drew (not called)
- 4th set can be anything (Pong, Kong, Chow)
- Can win on discard or self-draw

**Example:**
```
4-4-4 Bam (Pong - concealed)
6-6-6 Dot (Pong - concealed)
8-8-8 Wan (Pong - concealed)
2-3-4 Bam (Chow - can be exposed)
5-5 Dot (Pair)

Value: 2 points
```

**Strategy:**
- Don't call Pongs if going for this
- Requires patience
- Combines well with All Triplets
- High risk (might not complete)

### One Suit + Honors (Half Flush / 混一色)

**Pattern:** All tiles from one suit plus honors (winds/dragons)

**Requirements:**
- Choose one suit (all Bamboo, or all Characters, or all Dots)
- Can include winds and dragons
- All numbered tiles must be from the same suit

**Example:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
5-5-5 Bam (Pong)
7-8-9 Bam (Chow)
East-East-East (Pong - honor tile OK!)
6-6 Bam (Pair)

All numbered tiles are Bamboo ✓
Has honors (East) ✓
Value: 3 points (concealed) or 2 points (exposed)
```

**Strategy:**
- Commit early to one suit
- Discard other suits quickly
- Honors provide flexibility
- Worth pursuing if your initial hand leans one suit

## Hard Patterns (5-6 Points)

Rare and very valuable - often limit hands.

### One Suit Only (Full Flush / 清一色)

**Pattern:** All tiles from exactly one suit, no honors

**Requirements:**
- All tiles from one suit only
- No winds, no dragons
- Pure suited tiles

**Example:**
```
1-2-3 Dot (Chow)
4-5-6 Dot (Chow)
7-7-7 Dot (Pong)
8-9-9-9 Dot (Kong? No wait, that's wrong)

Actually:
1-2-3 Dot (Chow)
4-5-6 Dot (Chow)
7-7-7 Dot (Pong)
8-8-8 Dot (Pong)
9-9 Dot (Pair)

All Dots, no honors ✓
Value: 6 points (concealed) or 5 points (exposed)
```

**Strategy:**
- Very hard to complete
- Commit early and fully
- Discard everything else immediately
- High risk, high reward
- Often a limit hand

### All Terminals & Honors (混老头)

**Pattern:** Only 1s, 9s, winds, and dragons

**Requirements:**
- Every tile must be a terminal (1 or 9) or honor
- No 2-8 tiles allowed
- Typically all Pongs (can't make runs with 1-9 only)

**Example:**
```
1-1-1 Bam (Pong)
9-9-9 Dot (Pong)
East-East-East (Pong)
Red-Red-Red (Pong)
9-9 Wan (Pair)

Only terminals and honors ✓
Value: 4-5 points depending on variant
```

**Strategy:**
- Very difficult
- Limited tiles available
- Almost always All Triplets too
- Multiple patterns combine for huge points

## Special Patterns

### Thirteen Orphans (国士無双)

**Already covered in Phase 2 - extremely rare maximum hand**

**Requirements:** One each of all terminals and honors + one pair
**Value:** Maximum points (limit hand)

### Seven Pairs (七対子)

**Already covered in Phase 2 - special structure**

**Requirements:** Exactly 7 different pairs
**Value:** 2-4 points depending on variant

### All Green (緑一色)

**Pattern:** Only tiles that are entirely green (no red)

**Requirements:**
- Only 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 Bamboo (these are pure green)
- Green Dragon
- No other tiles

**Example:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
6-6-6 Bam (Pong)
8-8-8 Bam (Pong)
Green-Green-Green (Pong)
2-2 Bam (Pair)

All tiles are visually green ✓
Value: Limit hand (maximum points)
```

**Strategy:**
- Extremely rare
- Luck-dependent
- If you see it developing, commit fully!

## Pattern Combinations

**Multiple patterns can combine:**

**Example:**
```
Your hand (all Dots):
2-3-4 Dot (Chow)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
6-7-8 Dot (Chow)
Red-Red-Red (Pong - Dragon!)
9-9 Dot (Pair)

Patterns:
- Full Flush (all Dots except dragon - wait, that's Half Flush)

Actually:
- Half Flush (One suit + honors): 3 points
- Value Tile (Red Dragon): 1 point
- Total: 4 points!
```

Patterns multiply points dramatically!

## Pattern Recognition Practice

### Exercise 1: Identify the Pattern

**Hand A:**
```
3-4-5 Bam (Chow)
4-5-6 Wan (Chow)
5-6-7 Dot (Chow)
6-7-8 Bam (Chow)
3-3 Wan (Pair)
```
**Answer:** All Simples (all tiles are 2-8) + Pinfu (all chows, non-special pair, concealed)

**Hand B:**
```
1-1-1 Bam (Pong)
9-9-9 Dot (Pong)
East-East-East (Pong)
5-5-5 Wan (Pong)
Red-Red (Pair)
```
**Answer:** All Triplets (all pongs)

**Hand C:**
```
2-3-4 Wan (Chow)
5-6-7 Wan (Chow)
7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
West-West-West (Pong)
2-2 Wan (Pair)
```
**Answer:** Half Flush (all Wan + honors)

## Building Pattern Awareness

### Early Game

**Look at your initial tiles:**
- Multiple pairs → Consider Seven Pairs
- One suit dominant → Consider Flush
- Several terminals/honors → Consider Terminal-Honor patterns
- Balanced suits → Consider All Simples or Pinfu

### Mid Game

**Commit to a direction:**
- If pursuing a pattern, discard tiles that don't fit
- If going for speed, take whatever comes
- Balance current hand vs. remaining tiles

### Late Game

**Evaluate:**
- Can you still complete your pattern?
- Should you abandon it for a simple win?
- Are pattern tiles still available?

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Pursuing impossible patterns (tiles already discarded)
- ❌ Breaking a pattern at the last minute
- ❌ Not recognizing patterns you've accidentally made
- ❌ Overcommitting to rare patterns early
- ❌ Forgetting that exposed hands are worth less

## Strategy Tips

1. **Start simple** - Master All Simples and Value Tiles first
2. **Recognize accidentally** - Sometimes patterns emerge without planning
3. **Know when to abandon** - Don't chase impossible patterns
4. **Balance risk/reward** - Rare patterns are risky
5. **Learn common combinations** - Some patterns naturally pair together

## Next Steps

Now that you recognize patterns:
- Learn [Scoring Basics](scoring-basics.md) to calculate points
- Study [Strategic Discards](strategic-discards.md) to build better hands
- Master [Reading the Table](reading-table.md) to read opponents
