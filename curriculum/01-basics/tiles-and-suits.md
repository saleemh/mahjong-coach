# Understanding Tiles and Suits

**Phase 1: Foundation - Lesson 1**

This is your first and most important lesson. Understanding the tiles is the foundation of everything in mahjong. Take your time with this lesson - mastering tile recognition will make everything else much easier.

## Overview

A complete mahjong set contains **144 tiles** total:
- **108 suited tiles** (3 suits × 9 ranks × 4 copies)
- **28 honor tiles** (7 types × 4 copies)
- **8 bonus tiles** (4 flowers + 4 seasons)

## The Three Suits

Each suit has tiles numbered 1 through 9, with 4 identical copies of each number.

### 1. Bamboo (Sticks, Bams)
**Chinese:** 条 (tiáo) or 索 (suǒ)

The bamboo suit shows bamboo sticks:
- **1 Bamboo**: Often depicted as a bird or unique design
- **2-9 Bamboo**: Show the corresponding number of bamboo sticks

```
1-Bam  2-Bam  3-Bam  4-Bam  5-Bam  6-Bam  7-Bam  8-Bam  9-Bam
 🦜    | |    |||   ||||  |||||  |||| |||| |||  |||| ||||
                                 ||||      ||||  |||| ||||
```

**Total:** 36 bamboo tiles (9 ranks × 4 copies each)

### 2. Characters (Cracks, Wan)
**Chinese:** 万 (wàn) meaning "ten thousand"

Character tiles show Chinese numerals with the character 萬 (wan):
- Each tile displays the number in Chinese characters
- The character 萬 appears on each tile

```
1-Wan   2-Wan   3-Wan   4-Wan   5-Wan   6-Wan   7-Wan   8-Wan   9-Wan
 一萬    二萬    三萬    四萬    五萬    六萬    七萬    八萬    九萬
```

**Total:** 36 character tiles (9 ranks × 4 copies each)

### 3. Dots (Circles, Coins, Wheels)
**Chinese:** 筒 (tǒng) or 饼 (bǐng)

Dot tiles show circles arranged in patterns:
- **1 Dot**: Often larger or specially decorated
- **2-9 Dots**: Show the corresponding number of circles in various arrangements

```
1-Dot  2-Dot  3-Dot  4-Dot  5-Dot  6-Dot  7-Dot  8-Dot  9-Dot
  ●     ●●     ●●●    ●● ●●  ●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●●
        ●●           ●● ●●  ●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●● ●●●
                                   ●●●
```

**Total:** 36 dot tiles (9 ranks × 4 copies each)

## Honor Tiles (28 total)

Honor tiles are special tiles that don't belong to any suit.

### Wind Tiles (16 total)
**Chinese:** 风 (fēng)

Four types, each appearing 4 times:
- **East Wind** (东 Dōng) - 4 tiles
- **South Wind** (南 Nán) - 4 tiles
- **West Wind** (西 Xī) - 4 tiles
- **North Wind** (北 Běi) - 4 tiles

```
 East    South   West    North
  东      南      西      北
```

Wind tiles have special significance:
- They determine seating positions
- They can be valuable in scoring
- Your seat wind and the round wind matter for points

### Dragon Tiles (12 total)
**Chinese:** 三元 (sān yuán) meaning "three great scholars"

Three types, each appearing 4 times:
- **Red Dragon** (中 Zhōng, meaning "center") - 4 tiles
- **Green Dragon** (发 Fā, meaning "prosperity") - 4 tiles
- **White Dragon** (白 Bái, meaning "white") - 4 tiles

```
  Red     Green   White
  中       发      白/□
```

Note: White dragons are sometimes blank or have a decorative border.

## Bonus Tiles (8 total)

Bonus tiles are not used in forming winning hands but provide extra points.

### Flower Tiles (4 total)
Usually numbered 1-4, each associated with a season:
1. Plum Blossom (Spring)
2. Orchid (Summer)
3. Chrysanthemum (Autumn)
4. Bamboo (Winter)

### Season Tiles (4 total)
Explicitly representing the four seasons:
1. Spring
2. Summer
3. Autumn (Fall)
4. Winter

**Important:** Bonus tiles are immediately revealed when drawn and replaced with a new tile from the dead wall.

## Tile Categories for Gameplay

Understanding these categories will become important later:

### Terminals (Terminal Tiles)
The 1s and 9s of each suit:
- 1-Bam, 9-Bam
- 1-Wan, 9-Wan
- 1-Dot, 9-Dot

### Simples (Number Tiles)
The 2-8 of each suit (middle numbers)

### Honors
All wind and dragon tiles

### Terminal-Honors
Terminals AND honors combined (important for certain hand patterns)

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Tile Counting
- How many total tiles are suited tiles? **108**
- How many total wind tiles? **16**
- How many copies of each unique tile (except bonus)? **4**
- How many total tiles in a complete set? **144**

### Exercise 2: Recognition Drill
When you have access to a physical or digital mahjong set:
1. Separate all tiles by suit
2. Order each suit from 1 to 9
3. Verify you have 4 copies of each tile
4. Group all winds together, all dragons together
5. Practice identifying tiles at a glance

### Exercise 3: Terminology
Practice using the correct terms:
- "I need a 5-Bamboo" (not "5-sticks")
- "That's a West Wind" (not "West Dragon")
- "I have three 8-Dots" (not "three 8-circles")

## Memory Tips

1. **Bamboos:** Look for the bamboo stick patterns; remember 1-Bam often has a bird
2. **Characters:** These all have the 萬 character; learn to read Chinese numbers
3. **Dots:** Count the circles; 1-Dot is usually distinctive
4. **Winds:** Learn the Chinese characters - they're always the same
5. **Dragons:** 中 (red), 发 (green), 白 (white) - memorize these three

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- ❌ Confusing winds with dragons
- ❌ Mixing up bamboo and dot suits
- ❌ Not recognizing that 1-Bamboo often looks different
- ❌ Forgetting that bonus tiles don't count toward your 14-tile hand
- ❌ Thinking you can use different suits together in a run (you can't!)

## Next Steps

Once you can confidently identify all tiles:
- Move on to [Basic Terminology](basic-terminology.md) to learn the language of mahjong
- Then learn how these tiles are used in [Game Setup](game-setup.md)

## Quick Reference

| Category | Types | Copies Each | Total |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Suited Tiles | 27 (9×3 suits) | 4 | 108 |
| Wind Tiles | 4 | 4 | 16 |
| Dragon Tiles | 3 | 4 | 12 |
| Honor Tiles | 7 (winds+dragons) | 4 | 28 |
| Bonus Tiles | 8 (flowers+seasons) | 1 | 8 |
| **TOTAL** | **42 unique** | - | **144** |

**Time Investment:** Spend at least 2-3 days with this lesson. Tile recognition is fundamental - every minute you invest here will save you confusion later!

**Practice Goal:** Be able to quickly identify any tile shown to you within 1-2 seconds.
