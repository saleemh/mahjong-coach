# Basic Terminology

**Phase 1: Foundation - Lesson 2**

Learning the terminology will help you understand written guides, watch tutorial videos, and communicate clearly with other players. Don't worry about memorizing everything at once - you'll naturally pick up terms as you play.

## Regional Terminology Note

Chinese Classical Mahjong is played across many regions, and terminology varies by dialect. This guide uses **standard Mandarin romanization** (most common in written English guides), but you'll encounter **Cantonese terms** in many playing groups, especially in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and overseas Chinese communities.

**Key Differences:**

| English | Mandarin | Cantonese | Meaning |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Run/Sequence | Chow (吃) | Sheung/Seung (上) | 3 consecutive tiles |
| Win | Hu (和) | Sik/Sek (食/糊) | Declare winning |
| Triplet | Pong (碰) | Pong (碰) | Same! |
| Quad | Kong (杠) | Kong (槓) | Same! |

**Throughout this curriculum**, when you see terms like "Chow" or "Hu," know that your playing group might say "Sheung" or "Sik" instead. Both refer to the same game actions - just different dialects!

## Essential Game Terms

### Mahjong (麻将/麻雀)
**Pronunciation:** Mah-jong
- The name of the game itself
- Also what you declare when you win
- Literally means "sparrow" in Chinese

### Tile Categories

**Suited Tiles** (数牌)
- The three suits: Bamboo, Characters, and Dots
- Also called "number tiles" or "simples" (when referring to 2-8)

**Honor Tiles** (字牌)
- Wind tiles and Dragon tiles
- Cannot form runs/chows (only sets of 3 or 4 identical tiles)

**Terminals** (幺九牌)
- The 1s and 9s of each suit
- Important for certain hand patterns

**Simples** (中张牌)
- The 2 through 8 of each suit
- More flexible for forming runs

**Terminal-Honors** (么九牌)
- Terminals (1s and 9s) plus all Honor tiles
- Some valuable hands use only these

## Hand Components

### Set (Meld)
A group of tiles that form a valid combination:

**Pong (碰)** - Triplet
- Three identical tiles
- Example: 5-Bam, 5-Bam, 5-Bam
- Can be concealed (in your hand) or exposed (claimed from discard)

**Kong (杠)** - Quad
- Four identical tiles
- Example: East, East, East, East
- Worth extra points and gives you a replacement tile
- Four types: concealed, small exposed, big exposed, robbed

**Chow (吃)** - Run/Sequence
- Also called **Sheung/Seung (上)** in Cantonese
- Three consecutive suited tiles of the same suit
- Example: 4-Wan, 5-Wan, 6-Wan
- Can only be claimed from the player on your left
- Must be from a single suit (no mixing!)

**Pair (Eyes)** (对子/眼)
- Two identical tiles
- Every winning hand needs exactly one pair
- Also called "head" or "eyes"

### Complete Hand Structure

**Winning Hand:**
- 4 sets + 1 pair = 14 tiles total
- Sets can be any combination of Pongs, Kongs, or Chows
- Must have exactly one pair

**Example winning hand:**
```
3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Bam (Chow)
7-Dot, 7-Dot, 7-Dot (Pong)
Red, Red, Red (Pong)
2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan (Chow)
9-Wan, 9-Wan (Pair)
```

## Hand Status Terms

### Concealed (門前 - Menzen)
- All tiles still in your hand
- Not revealed to other players
- Worth more points
- Gives you more flexibility

### Exposed (明 - Min)
- Tiles you've claimed from discards and revealed
- Visible to all players
- Restricts some winning options
- Generally worth fewer points

### Ready (聴牌 - Tingpai)
- One tile away from winning
- Waiting for your winning tile
- May be declared or kept secret depending on variant

### Waiting (待ち - Machi)
- The tile(s) you need to complete your hand
- Example: "I'm waiting on 5-Dot"

## Gameplay Actions

### Draw (摸 - Mo)
- Taking a tile from the wall
- Done at the start of your turn

### Discard (打 - Da)
- Placing a tile face-up in the center
- Done at the end of your turn
- Can be claimed by opponents

### Call (鸣 - Ming)
- Claiming a discarded tile to form a set

- Makes your set exposed

### Win/Declare Mahjong (和 - Hu)
- Also called **Sik/Sek (食/糊)** in Cantonese
- Completing a valid 14-tile hand
- Can be from self-draw or someone's discard
- Must declare immediately

### Pass (过 - Guo)
- Choosing not to claim a discarded tile
- Let play continue to the next player

## Table Positions

### Winds (Wind Seats)
- **East (东 - Dong):** Dealer position, usually goes first
- **South (南 - Nan):** To the right of East
- **West (西 - Xi):** Across from East
- **North (北 - Bei):** To the left of East

### Dealer (庄家)
- The player in the East position
- Has special privileges and responsibilities
- Wins and losses are worth more
- Rotates after each hand

### Player Wind (门风)
- Your current seat position
- Changes as dealer rotates
- Affects scoring

### Round Wind (场风)
- The prevailing wind for the current round
- Starts as East, rotates through South, West, North
- Affects scoring

## Game Structure

### Hand (局)
- A single complete game from setup to someone winning or draw
- Usually lasts 5-15 minutes

### Round (圈)
- Four hands (one with each player as dealer)
- Named after winds: East Round, South Round, etc.

### Game (场)
- A complete session, typically 4 or 8 rounds
- Can last 1-2 hours

### Wall (牌墙)
- The square structure of tiles built at game start
- Each player builds their section (18 tiles long, 2 high)

### Dead Wall (王牌)
- Last 14 tiles of the wall
- Reserved for replacements (Kong, Flower tiles)
- Not drawn during normal play

### Live Wall (牌山)
- The remaining tiles available for drawing
- Depletes as game progresses

## Special Situations

### Dead Hand (死牌)
- An invalid hand that cannot win
- Usually from an incorrect number of tiles
- Player can still participate but cannot declare win

### Draw (流局)
- Game ends with no winner
- Happens when live wall is exhausted
- Dealer may stay dealer depending on rules

### Sacred Discard (振聴 - Furiten)
- In some variants, prevents you from winning on someone's discard
- Occurs when you could have won earlier but passed
- Can still win by self-draw

## Chinese Classical Specific Terms

### Limit Hand (役満)
- Maximum-scoring hand
- Special, rare patterns
- Often worth the maximum points allowed

### Doubles (番)

- Each special pattern adds doubles
- Points increase exponentially with doubles

### Points (分)
- The scoring units
- Base points modified by doubles
- Different for dealer vs non-dealer

## Common Phrases

**At the table:**
- "Pong!" - I'm claiming that discard for a triplet
- "Kong!" - I'm declaring four of a kind
- "Chow!" or "Sheung!" (Cantonese) - I'm claiming that discard for a run (only from left player)
- "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" (Cantonese) - I've won!
- "Draw/Next hand" - No winner, let's play again

**During play:**
- "Your turn" - Indicating whose turn it is
- "No call" or "Pass" - I'm not claiming that discard

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identify the Set Type
Look at these combinations and name them:
1. 6-Dot, 6-Dot, 6-Dot → **Pong**
2. 2-Bam, 3-Bam, 4-Bam → **Chow**
3. West, West, West, West → **Kong**
4. 8-Wan, 8-Wan → **Pair**

### Exercise 2: Valid or Invalid?
Can these form a Chow?
1. 5-Bam, 6-Bam, 7-Bam → **Valid** ✓
2. 8-Dot, 9-Dot, 1-Dot → **Invalid** ✗ (sequences don't wrap)
3. 3-Wan, 4-Dot, 5-Bam → **Invalid** ✗ (must be same suit)
4. East, South, West → **Invalid** ✗ (honors don't form runs)

### Exercise 3: Count the Tiles
How many tiles in:
1. A complete hand? → **14 tiles**
2. A Pong? → **3 tiles**
3. A Kong? → **4 tiles**
4. A standard winning hand structure? → **4 sets + 1 pair = 14 tiles**

## Memory Tips

**For set types:**
- **P**ong = **P**air + one more (3 identical)
- **K**ong = **K**ings have 4 corners (4 identical)
- **C**how = **C**onsecutive (run of 3)

**For positions:**
- Look at a compass: E-S-W-N goes clockwise
- Same direction as mahjong turns

**For tiles needed:**
- Concealed = **C**oncealed in hand
- Exposed = **E**xposed for Everyone

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- ❌ Trying to make a Chow with different suits (must be same suit!)
- ❌ Forgetting that honor tiles can't form runs
- ❌ Calling "Pong" when you only have 2 tiles (need 3!)
- ❌ Thinking you can wrap sequences (9-1-2 doesn't work)
- ❌ Confusing "ready" with "winning" (ready is one away, winning is complete)
