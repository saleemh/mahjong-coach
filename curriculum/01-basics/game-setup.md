# Game Setup

**Phase 1: Foundation - Lesson 3**

Setting up a mahjong game properly is an important ritual that creates the foundation for fair play. While it might seem complex at first, you'll quickly get the hang of it with practice.

## What You'll Need

### Equipment
- **144 mahjong tiles** (complete set)
- **4 players** (mahjong is specifically a 4-player game)
- **Dice** (two dice are standard)
- **Wind indicator** (optional, but helpful for beginners)
- **Score sheet and pencil** (for tracking points)
- **Table or playing surface** (ideally with a mat to reduce noise)

### Optional Items
- Tile racks or trays (help organize your tiles)
- Chips or counting sticks (for tracking points)
- Timer (for timed games)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Determine Seating Positions

The four seats correspond to the four winds: East, South, West, North.

**Method 1: Random Wind Draw**
1. Take one of each wind tile (East, South, West, North)
2. Place them face down and shuffle
3. Each player draws one tile
4. **East:** Sits anywhere and becomes the dealer
5. **South:** Sits to the right of East
6. **West:** Sits across from East
7. **North:** Sits to the left of East

```
        North (北)
           |
West (西) --- East (东) [Dealer]
           |
        South (南)
```

**Method 2: Dice Roll**
1. All players roll dice
2. Highest roll becomes East (dealer)
3. Count counterclockwise from East to assign other positions

**Important:** In Chinese mahjong, turns proceed **counterclockwise** (East → North → West → South → East)

### Step 2: Building the Wall

Each player builds their section of the wall in front of them.

**Process:**
1. **Turn all tiles face down** and shuffle thoroughly
2. Each player takes **36 tiles** (144 ÷ 4 = 36)
3. **Build your wall:**
   - Stack tiles in pairs (face down)
   - Create a row **18 stacks long** and **2 stacks high**
   - Keep it straight and neat

```
Your wall section (example):
▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢
▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢
← 18 stacks (36 tiles) →
```

4. **Push walls together** to form a square in the center

```
           North's Wall
        ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
        ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢

▢▢▢▢▢▢              ▢▢▢▢▢▢
▢▢▢▢▢▢              ▢▢▢▢▢▢
West's Wall         East's Wall
▢▢▢▢▢▢              ▢▢▢▢▢▢
▢▢▢▢▢▢              ▢▢▢▢▢▢

        ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
        ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
           South's Wall
```

### Step 3: Breaking the Wall

This determines where dealing begins.

**Process:**
1. **East (dealer) rolls two dice** and announces the total
2. **Count counterclockwise** from East to determine which wall to break:
   - 1 or 5 or 9 → East's wall
   - 2 or 6 or 10 → South's wall
   - 3 or 7 or 11 → West's wall
   - 4 or 8 or 12 → North's wall

3. **The designated player rolls the dice again**
4. **Count stacks from the right** of that player's wall (from their perspective)
   - Example: Roll 7 → count 7 stacks from the right
   - Break after that 7th stack

5. **Separate the dead wall:**
   - Last 7 stacks (14 tiles) become the dead wall
   - Move these aside but keep them in order
   - These are only used for Kong and flower replacements

```
Example: Break after 7th stack from right

Dead Wall (last 7 stacks)
     ↓
▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ║ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢
▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ║ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢ ▢▢
                      ↑
                Start dealing here
```

### Step 4: Dealing Tiles

Tiles are dealt in a specific pattern to speed up the process.

**Dealing Pattern:**
1. **Start at the break point** in the wall
2. **Deal counterclockwise** (East → North → West → South)
3. **Deal in groups of 4 tiles** to speed things up

**Round 1-3:** Each player takes 4 tiles, three times (12 tiles each)
- East takes 4, North takes 4, West takes 4, South takes 4
- Repeat twice more
- Everyone now has 12 tiles

**Round 4:** Each player takes 1 tile (13 tiles each)
- East takes 1, North takes 1, West takes 1, South takes 1

**East's extra tile:** East takes one more tile (14 total)
- East is now ready to start the game
- East has 14 tiles, everyone else has 13

**Summary:**
- **East (dealer):** 14 tiles
- **Other players:** 13 tiles each
- **Total dealt:** 53 tiles

### Step 5: Organize Your Hand

Once you have your tiles:

1. **Turn them face up** (concealed from other players)
2. **Sort by suit and type:**
   - Group Bamboo together (1-9)
   - Group Characters together (1-9)
   - Group Dots together (1-9)
   - Group Winds together
   - Group Dragons together
   - Put flowers/seasons aside

3. **Reveal flower and season tiles immediately:**
   - If you have any flowers or seasons, place them face up in front of you
   - Draw replacement tiles from the dead wall (one for each bonus tile)
   - These give you extra points but don't count toward your 14-tile hand

4. **Assess your hand:**
   - Look for pairs
   - Look for potential sets (Pongs, Kongs, Chows)
   - Start thinking about strategy

## Special Setup Rules

### Flowers and Seasons
- **Always revealed immediately** when drawn (including during initial deal)
- **Replaced immediately** from the dead wall
- **Worth bonus points** at the end
- Each is associated with a player position (1=East, 2=South, 3=West, 4=North)
- Extra points if you get your own flower/season

### Dead Wall
- **14 tiles reserved** (7 stacks of 2)
- Used only for:
  - Replacing Kongs
  - Replacing Flowers/Seasons
- Replenished from the back of the live wall when used

### Charleston (American variant only)
- **Not used in Chinese Classical**
- If you're playing American rules, this is a tile exchange before play
- For Chinese Classical, skip this step entirely

## Practice Setup

**Solo Practice:**
Try building and breaking the wall by yourself:
1. Shuffle 36 tiles
2. Build an 18×2 wall
3. Roll dice and practice breaking it
4. Deal tiles as if 4 players were present

**Time yourself:** Experienced players can complete setup in 2-3 minutes!

## Common Setup Mistakes

- ❌ Building walls that are uneven or not straight
- ❌ Forgetting to shuffle thoroughly (leads to predictable tiles)
- ❌ Miscounting when breaking the wall
- ❌ Dealing in the wrong direction (should be counterclockwise)
- ❌ Giving East only 13 tiles (East needs 14!)
- ❌ Not revealing flowers/seasons immediately
- ❌ Forgetting to set aside the dead wall

## Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] Shuffle all 144 tiles face down
- [ ] Each player builds a wall (18 stacks × 2 high = 36 tiles)
- [ ] Push walls together to form square
- [ ] East rolls dice to determine which wall to break
- [ ] Designated player rolls again to determine break point
- [ ] Separate dead wall (7 stacks = 14 tiles)
- [ ] Deal tiles (3 rounds of 4, then 1 each, then East gets one more)
- [ ] Everyone organizes their hand
- [ ] Reveal and replace any flowers/seasons
- [ ] East has 14 tiles, others have 13
- [ ] Ready to play!

## Cultural Notes

**The ritual of setup:**
- Setting up mahjong is part of the game's tradition
- The shuffling sound is iconic and enjoyable
- Taking turns building the wall is a shared responsibility
- The dice rolls add randomness and fairness
- Many players see setup as meditation time

**Modern variations:**
- Automatic mahjong tables can shuffle and deal instantly
- Online platforms handle setup automatically
- But learning traditional setup connects you to the game's heritage

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to set up the game:
- Understand the [Game Objective](objective.md) - what you're trying to achieve
- Then move on to Phase 2 to learn how to actually play!

---

**Practice Goal:** Be able to build a wall and deal tiles confidently. Do this a few times until it feels natural.

**Time to Master:** 3-5 practice sessions should make you comfortable with setup.
