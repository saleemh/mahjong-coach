# Game Objective

**Phase 1: Foundation - Lesson 4**

Understanding what you're trying to achieve is crucial before you start playing. Mahjong's objective is elegantly simple: **be the first to complete a valid 14-tile winning hand.**

## The Winning Formula

### Standard Winning Hand
```
4 Sets + 1 Pair = 14 Tiles
```

**That's it!** Every standard winning hand follows this formula.

### What Counts as a Set?

A set is **three or four tiles** in one of these forms:

**Pong (Triplet)** - 3 identical tiles
```
Examples:
5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot
East, East, East
Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon
```

**Kong (Quad)** - 4 identical tiles
```
Examples:
7-Bam, 7-Bam, 7-Bam, 7-Bam
North, North, North, North
```

**Chow/Sheung (Run)** - 3 consecutive tiles of the same suit
```
Examples:
2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan
6-Dot, 7-Dot, 8-Dot

NOT valid:
8-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Bam (doesn't wrap around!)
5-Bam, 6-Dot, 7-Wan (must be same suit!)
East, South, West (honors can't form runs!)
```

### What Counts as a Pair?

A pair is simply **2 identical tiles**:
```
Examples:
9-Wan, 9-Wan
Green Dragon, Green Dragon
3-Bam, 3-Bam
```

## Example Winning Hands

### Example 1: Mixed Hand
```
Set 1: 1-Bam, 2-Bam, 3-Bam         (Chow - Bamboo run)
Set 2: 5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot         (Pong - Dots triplet)
Set 3: West, West, West             (Pong - Winds triplet)
Set 4: 7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan         (Chow - Characters run)
Pair:  Red Dragon, Red Dragon       (Dragon pair)

Total: 14 tiles ✓
```

### Example 2: All Chows
```
Set 1: 2-Wan, 3-Wan, 4-Wan         (Chow)
Set 2: 3-Wan, 4-Wan, 5-Wan         (Chow)
Set 3: 7-Dot, 8-Dot, 9-Dot         (Chow)
Set 4: 1-Bam, 2-Bam, 3-Bam         (Chow)
Pair:  5-Wan, 5-Wan                 (Pair)

Total: 14 tiles ✓
```

### Example 3: All Pongs
```
Set 1: 4-Dot, 4-Dot, 4-Dot         (Pong)
Set 2: 8-Bam, 8-Bam, 8-Bam         (Pong)
Set 3: 2-Wan, 2-Wan, 2-Wan         (Pong)
Set 4: South, South, South          (Pong)
Pair:  6-Dot, 6-Dot                 (Pair)

Total: 14 tiles ✓
```

### Example 4: With a Kong
```
Set 1: 3-Bam, 4-Bam, 5-Bam         (Chow)
Set 2: Green, Green, Green, Green   (Kong - counts as 1 set!)
Set 3: 7-Dot, 8-Dot, 9-Dot         (Chow)
Set 4: 1-Wan, 1-Wan, 1-Wan         (Pong)
Pair:  9-Bam, 9-Bam                 (Pair)

Total: 15 tiles (Kong = 4) ✓
Note: With a Kong, you have 15 tiles total, but it still counts as "4 sets + 1 pair"
```

## How You Win

### Two Ways to Win

**1. Self-Draw (Tsumo in Japanese, Zi Mo in Chinese)**
- You draw the winning tile yourself from the wall
- Generally worth more points
- Announce "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" (Cantonese)

**2. Win on Discard (Ron in Japanese, Hu in Chinese)**
- Another player discards the exact tile you need
- You claim it immediately
- Announce "Mahjong!" or "Sik!" (Cantonese)

### The Moment of Victory

When you complete your hand:
1. **Declare immediately:** "Mahjong!" or "Sik!"
2. **Reveal your entire hand** face-up
3. **Show the winning structure:** Organize into 4 sets + 1 pair
4. **Calculate points** (covered in Phase 3)
5. **Record the score**

**Important:** You must declare when you win. You cannot hide a winning hand!

## Being "Ready" (Tenpai)

Before you win, you're usually in a "ready" state:

### Ready Hand = 13 Tiles Away from Winning
When you have 13 tiles that form a nearly-complete hand, you're **ready** (聴牌 - tīng pái).

**Example of a Ready Hand:**
```
You have: 1-Bam, 2-Bam, 3-Bam (Chow)
          5-Dot, 5-Dot, 5-Dot (Pong)
          West, West, West     (Pong)
          7-Wan, 8-Wan, 9-Wan (Chow)
          Red, Red             (Almost-pair)

You're waiting for: Red Dragon (to complete your pair)
```

Any time you're one tile away from winning, you're ready. The tile you need is called your **wait tile** or **waiting tile**.

### Types of Waits

**Pair Wait** - Waiting to complete your pair
```
You have: Red, Red
Waiting for: Red Dragon (to make a triplet? No! To make your pair + another set)

Actually, for pair wait:
You have: 4 complete sets + 1 tile
Waiting for: Another copy of that tile
```

**Single Wait** - Waiting for one specific tile
```
Complete sets + 1-Bam, 2-Bam
Waiting for: 3-Bam (to complete the run)
```

**Two-Way Wait** - Waiting for either of two tiles
```
Complete sets + 4-Wan, 5-Wan
Waiting for: 3-Wan or 6-Wan (either completes the run)
```

**Multi-Way Wait** - Waiting for multiple different tiles
```
More complex waiting patterns exist
You'll learn these as you gain experience
```

## Special Winning Patterns

While "4 sets + 1 pair" is standard, there are special exceptions:

### Seven Pairs (Chī Tōitsu)
- 7 different pairs (no identical pairs)
- Worth special points
- Relatively rare

```
Example:
1-Bam, 1-Bam
3-Dot, 3-Dot
5-Wan, 5-Wan
7-Bam, 7-Bam
East, East
Red Dragon, Red Dragon
9-Wan, 9-Wan

Total: 7 pairs = 14 tiles ✓
```

### Thirteen Orphans (Shí Sān Yāo)
- Very rare special hand
- Uses all terminals and honors
- Extremely valuable
- Don't worry about this as a beginner!

## Invalid "Hands" (Not Winning)

### Common Mistakes

**Wrong Number of Tiles**
```
❌ 3 sets + 1 pair = 11 tiles (too few!)
❌ 5 sets + 1 pair = 17 tiles (too many!)
✓ 4 sets + 1 pair = 14 tiles
```

**No Pair**
```
❌ 4 sets + no pair = 12 tiles
Even if you have 14 tiles, you MUST have exactly 1 pair!
```

**Two Pairs**
```
❌ 3 sets + 2 pairs = 13 tiles
Can't have two pairs (unless doing Seven Pairs special hand)
```

**Invalid Runs**
```
❌ 8-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Bam (doesn't wrap!)
❌ 5-Bam, 6-Wan, 7-Dot (different suits!)
❌ East, South, West (honors can't form runs!)
```

**Mixed Sets**
```
❌ 3-Bam, 3-Dot, 3-Wan (same number, different suits - not valid!)
Sets must be either:
  - Identical tiles (Pong/Kong), OR
  - Consecutive same-suit tiles (Chow)
```

## Your Goal Each Hand

As you play, you're constantly working toward:

1. **Drawing useful tiles** that help you form sets
2. **Discarding useless tiles** that don't fit your hand
3. **Building toward 4 sets + 1 pair**
4. **Getting to ready** (13 tiles, waiting for 1)
5. **Completing your hand** and declaring Mahjong/Sik!

## Strategy Teaser

Some questions to think about (covered more in later phases):

- Which tiles should you discard?
- Should you claim discarded tiles or keep your hand concealed?
- Should you go for a fast, low-point hand or a slower, high-point hand?
- How do you read what other players might be collecting?

Don't worry about these yet - just focus on understanding the basic objective!

**Checkpoint:** Before moving to Phase 2, make sure you can:
1. Identify what makes a valid winning hand
2. Distinguish between Pong, Kong, and Chow
3. Recognize when a hand has the correct structure (4 sets + 1 pair)
4. Count tiles to verify 14 total

**Review if needed:** These concepts are fundamental to everything that follows!
