### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

- Does it track statistics?
- Is it free or paid?

**Start with:** One platform, learn it well before trying others

### Step 2: Understand the Platform's Rules

**Critical: Verify the ruleset!**
```
Check settings for:
- Variant (Chinese Classical, Hong Kong, Taiwanese, etc.)
- Scoring system (which patterns, point values)
- Special rules (flowers, kongs, ready declaration)
- Time limits per turn
```

**Many platforms let you customize rules in private rooms!**

### Step 3: Start with Bot Games

**Before playing humans:**
1. Play against AI/bots to learn interface
2. Practice without pressure
3. Get comfortable with controls
4. Learn platform-specific features
5. Win a few games for confidence

**Expect:** Easy bots are VERY easy. Use them to learn, then move up.

### Step 4: Play Ranked/Casual Games

**Start with casual/unranked:**
- Lower pressure
- Forgiving of mistakes
- Good for experimentation
- Builds experience

**Move to ranked when:**
- You understand all rules
- You're winning 20-25% of games (normal rate)
- You want competitive play
- You're tracking improvement

## Making the Most of Online Play

### Pre-Game Preparation

**Before each session:**
- [ ] Review one concept from curriculum
- [ ] Set a time limit (don't overplay)
- [ ] Choose your focus (speed? strategy? pattern practice?)
- [ ] Clear mind - online can be intense!

### During the Game

**Focus on:**
1. **Observation** - What are opponents doing?
2. **Decision-making** - Think through each discard
3. **Pattern recognition** - Spot opportunities
4. **Risk management** - Balance offense and defense
5. **Learning** - Mental note of mistakes

**Don't:**
- Play on autopilot
- Rush decisions (use your time)
- Get tilted by losses
- Ignore what opponents are doing
- Forget to enjoy it!

### Post-Game Analysis

**After each game (especially losses):**
1. **Review the replay** if available
2. **Identify key moments:**
   - When did you fall behind?
   - What was your best/worst discard?
   - Did you read opponents correctly?
3. **Write quick notes:**
   - What pattern did you pursue?
   - What worked/didn't work?
   - What would you do differently?
4. **Check statistics:**
   - Win rate trend
   - Average score
   - Common mistakes

## Online-Specific Strategies

### Adapting to Fast Play

**Online games are usually faster:**
- Decision time limits (often 15-30 seconds)
- No social chatting between moves
- Rapid succession of games

**To adapt:**
- Practice quick evaluation (use solo drills)
- Develop intuition for common decisions
- Don't overthink simple discards
- Save thinking time for critical moments

### Reading Online Opponents

**You can still observe:**
- Discard speed (hesitation vs. confidence)
- Calling patterns (aggressive vs. conservative)
- Style from previous hands
- Stats if the platform shows them

**You cannot see:**
- Physical tells
- Facial expressions
- Body language

**Adapt:** Rely more on discard reading and pattern recognition

### Dealing with Disconnects

**If someone disconnects:**
- Most platforms auto-play for them
- Don't feel bad about winning
- It's part of online play

**If YOU disconnect:**
- Try to reconnect quickly
- Some platforms penalize abandonment
- Check your internet before ranked games

## Common Online Platforms Features

### Ranking Systems

**Most platforms use:**
- **ELO/MMR** - Numerical rating that goes up with wins, down with losses
- **Dan/Kyu** - Traditional ranking (like martial arts belts)
- **Leagues/Tiers** - Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc.

**Understanding rank:**
- Starting rank is usually middle-low
- 25% win rate = maintaining rank (4 players, 1 winner)
- >25% win rate = climbing
- <25% win rate = dropping

**Don't obsess over rank!** Focus on improvement, rank follows.

### Statistics Tracking

**Useful stats to monitor:**
- **Win rate** - Should be ~20-30% for balanced gameplay
- **Average placement** - Aim for 2.5 or better (out of 4 players)
- **Deal-in rate** - How often you discard winning tiles (lower is better)
- **Riichi/Ready rate** - How often you reach ready status
- **Average hand value** - Are you building valuable hands?

**Track over time:**
```
Month 1: 15% win rate, 2.8 avg placement
Month 2: 22% win rate, 2.6 avg placement ← improving!
Month 3: 25% win rate, 2.4 avg placement ← great progress!
```

### Replay Analysis

**If platform offers replays:**
1. Review close games (won by small margin or lost narrowly)
2. Identify the turning point
3. See what opponents were collecting
4. Learn from winner's strategy
5. Note your mistakes clearly

**Focus areas:**
- Discards that dealt into someone's hand
- Missed opportunities to declare ready
- Wrong pattern pursuits
- Good decisions that paid off
