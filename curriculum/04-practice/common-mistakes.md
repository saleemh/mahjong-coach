# Common Mistakes

**Phase 4: Practice & Refinement**

Learning what NOT to do is just as important as learning what to do. This guide covers the most common mistakes beginners and intermediate players make, along with how to fix them.

## Tile and Rule Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Invalid Chow/Run Combinations

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Trying to make a run with:
- 8-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Bam (wrapping around)
- 5-Bam, 6-Dot, 7-Wan (different suits)
- East, South, West (honors don't form runs)
```

**✓ Correct:**
- Runs must be consecutive: 5-6-7, not 5-7-9
- Runs must be same suit: all Bamboo, all Dots, OR all Characters
- Honors NEVER form runs (only Pongs/Kongs)

**How to avoid:** Always double-check suit and sequence before calling Chow

### Mistake 2: Miscounting Tiles

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Declaring Mahjong with:
- 15 tiles (forgot about a drawn tile)
- 13 tiles (never drew the 14th)
- 12 tiles (lost track during calls)
```

**✓ Correct:**
- Winning hand = exactly 14 tiles
- Exception: Kongs add extra tiles (4 instead of 3)
- Always count before declaring!

**How to avoid:** Pause and count carefully before declaring Mahjong

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Discard After Calling

**❌ Wrong:**
```
1. Call "Pong!" on a discarded tile
2. Form the Pong
3. Forget to discard
4. Draw another tile (now you have too many!)
```

**✓ Correct:**
```
1. Call "Pong!"
2. Form the Pong
3. DISCARD ONE TILE
4. Play continues from you
```

**How to avoid:** Make discarding automatic after any call (muscle memory)

### Mistake 4: Calling Chow from Wrong Player

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Player across from you discards 5-Wan
You have 4-Wan, 6-Wan
You call "Chow!" → ILLEGAL!
```

**✓ Correct:**
- Chow can ONLY be called from the player to your LEFT
- Pong/Kong can be called from anyone
- Remember this fundamental rule!

**How to avoid:** Always check: "Is this the player to my left?"

### Mistake 5: Not Revealing Flowers Immediately

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Draw a flower tile
Keep it in hand
Forget about it
Accidentally discard it later
```

**✓ Correct:**
```
Draw a flower/season
Immediately reveal it
Place it face-up in front of you
Draw replacement from dead wall
Continue your turn
```

**How to avoid:** Make revealing bonus tiles automatic and immediate

## Strategic Mistakes

### Mistake 6: Calling Every Possible Tile

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Early game, someone discards 3-Dot
You CAN Pong (have 3-3 Dot)
You call it without thinking
Now your hand is exposed and inflexible
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Ask yourself:
- Do I NEED to call this?
- Does it lock me into a bad pattern?
- Am I exposing my strategy too early?
- Would waiting be better?
```

**How to avoid:** Think before calling - concealed hands are worth more!

### Mistake 7: Not Committing to a Pattern

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Hand has mostly Dots, a few Bamboo, some honors
You discard Dots to keep variety
Never commit to a direction
End up with scattered, useless tiles
```

**✓ Better:**
```
By mid-game, choose a direction:
- Commit to Dot flush → discard everything else
- Go for All Simples → discard terminals/honors
- Pursue All Triplets → avoid calling Chows
Stick with your choice!
```

**How to avoid:** Decide on a strategy by turn 5-7 and commit

### Mistake 8: Chasing Impossible Patterns

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Want Full Flush (all Bamboo)
All 5-Bamboos already discarded
Still trying to build sets with 4-6 Bamboo
Impossible to complete!
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Track visible tiles:
- 3 copies of 7-Dot discarded
- Can't wait for 7-Dot anymore
- Abandon that wait, find alternatives
```

**How to avoid:** Count tiles and abandon impossible waits early

### Mistake 9: Ignoring Opponent Signals

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Player A has exposed: 3-4-5 Wan, 6-7-8 Wan
Obviously going for Wan flush
You discard 9-Wan → Player A wins!
You ignored obvious signals
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Player has exposed Wan sets
→ Don't discard ANY Wan tiles!
→ Wan is extremely dangerous
→ Find other discards
```

**How to avoid:** Always watch exposed sets before discarding

### Mistake 10: Being Too Defensive

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Late game, you're far from ready
You only discard previously-discarded tiles
You never improve your hand
Game ends in draw, you had no chance
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Balance defense and offense:
- If you're close to winning: take risks
- If you're far: play it safe
- Adapt based on situation
Balance is key!
```

**How to avoid:** Assess your position and adjust strategy accordingly

## Decision-Making Mistakes

### Mistake 11: Autopilot Discarding

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Drawing and discarding without thinking
Not considering each tile's value
Missing opportunities
Making careless mistakes
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Every discard, ask:
- What does this help/hurt in my hand?
- Is this safe against opponents?
- Are there better options?
- What's my plan?
```

**How to avoid:** Slow down, think through each decision

### Mistake 12: Focusing Only on Your Hand

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Looking only at your tiles
Not watching discards
Missing opponent patterns
Dealing into hands that were obvious
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Divide attention:
- 60% on your hand
- 40% on opponents and discards
Balance self-improvement with table awareness
```

**How to avoid:** Force yourself to look at discards before each throw

### Mistake 13: Overvaluing Perfect Hands

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Have a ready hand worth 16 points
Draw a tile that could START a 64-point pattern
Break ready to chase the big hand
Never complete it, someone else wins
```

**✓ Better:**
```
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush:
- Ready hand now > potential big hand later
- Don't break ready for unlikely improvements
- Especially in late game!
```

**How to avoid:** Recognize when "good enough" is better than "perfect"

### Mistake 14: Not Adapting to Game State

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Using the same strategy every game
Not adjusting based on:
- Dealer position
- Score situation
- Opponents' styles
- Remaining tiles
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Adapt to circumstances:
- Behind in points? Take risks for big hands
- Ahead in points? Play safe, secure lead
- Dealer? Consider dealer bonuses
- Last hand? Adjust for final push
```

**How to avoid:** Start each game with a flexible mindset

## Scoring and Calculation Mistakes

### Mistake 15: Not Knowing Point Values

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Win with a hand, have no idea what it's worth
Pursuing patterns without knowing their value
Can't decide if risk is worth reward
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Learn basic values:
- All Simples: low-medium
- Half Flush: medium-high
- Full Flush: high
- Seven Pairs: medium
Know roughly what you're building!
```

**How to avoid:** Study scoring charts, use them during games

### Mistake 16: Ignoring Flower/Season Bonuses

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Win a hand, forget you have your flower
Missing out on bonus points
Or: Not drawing replacement tiles for flowers
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Always reveal flowers/seasons immediately
Remember they add points to final score
Draw your replacement tiles!
```

**How to avoid:** Make flower handling a habit

## Psychological Mistakes

### Mistake 17: Tilting After Bad Luck

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Bad luck several hands in a row
Getting frustrated
Making reckless calls
Playing emotionally
Losing more as a result
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Bad luck happens in mahjong:
- Take a deep breath
- Remember long-term thinking
- Focus on good decisions, not results
- Take a break if needed
```

**How to avoid:** Recognize when emotions affect play, step away

### Mistake 18: Analysis Paralysis

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Overthinking every single decision
Taking forever to discard
Stressing about perfect play
Slowing down the game
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Balance thinking with action:
- Simple decisions: quick discards
- Critical moments: take time
- Build intuition through practice
- Trust your judgment
```

**How to avoid:** Set personal time limits for routine decisions

### Mistake 19: Not Learning from Losses

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Lose a game
Blame bad luck
Move on without reflection
Repeat the same mistakes
```

**✓ Better:**
```
After each loss:
- Identify one mistake you made
- Understand why it was wrong
- Plan how to avoid it next time
- Track patterns in your errors
```

**How to avoid:** Use the [Practice Log](../../practice-logs/template.md) to track learnings

### Mistake 20: Comparing to Experts Too Soon

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Watch expert players
Try to copy advanced techniques
Get frustrated when you can't
Feel inadequate as a beginner
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Progress is a journey:
- Master basics first
- Gradually add complexity
- Compare yourself to your past self
- Celebrate small improvements
```

**How to avoid:** Set realistic expectations, focus on personal growth

## Table Etiquette Mistakes

### Mistake 21: Not Calling Clearly

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Mumble "pong" quietly
Grab tile before announcing
Unclear what you're doing
Confusion at the table
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Clear declarations:
- Loud, clear voice: "Pong!"
- Announce BEFORE taking tile
- Show your matching tiles
- No ambiguity
```

**How to avoid:** Practice announcing confidently

### Mistake 22: Slow Play

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Taking 5 minutes per decision
Overthinking routine discards
Holding up the game
Frustrating other players
```

**✓ Better:**
```
Respect others' time:
- Routine discards: 5-10 seconds
- Important decisions: 30 seconds max
- Keep the game flowing
- Apologize if you need extra time
```

**How to avoid:** Practice decision-making speed with solo drills

### Mistake 23: Poor Communication

**❌ Wrong:**
```
Declaring Mahjong unclearly
Not showing hand properly
Rushing through verification
Missing errors
```

**✓ Better:**
```
When you win:
- Clear declaration: "Mahjong!"
- Reveal ALL tiles
- Organize into 4 sets + 1 pair
- Let others verify
- Calculate together
```

**How to avoid:** Take your time with wins, be transparent

## How to Fix Your Mistakes

### Step 1: Identify Your Patterns

**Track your mistakes:**
```
Use the practice log:
- Game 1: Dealt in with dangerous 5-Dot
- Game 2: Broke ready too early
- Game 3: Didn't watch opponent discards
- Pattern: Weak defensive play!
```

### Step 2: Focus on One Issue at a Time

**Don't try to fix everything at once:**
```
Week 1: Focus on safe discarding
Week 2: Focus on pattern recognition
Week 3: Focus on speed
Etc.
```

### Step 3: Practice Deliberately

**Target your weakness:**
```
If you struggle with tile counting:
→ Do tile counting drills daily
→ Track tiles during every game
→ Check yourself constantly
```

### Step 4: Get Feedback

**Ask others:**
- Play with experienced players
- Ask for critique
- Watch your own replays
- Join communities for advice

### Step 5: Measure Improvement

**Track progress:**
```
Month 1: Deal in rate 35% (too high!)
Month 2: Deal in rate 28% (improving)
Month 3: Deal in rate 22% (much better!)
```
