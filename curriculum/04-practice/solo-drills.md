# Solo Drills

**Phase 4: Practice & Refinement**

You don't always need three other players to improve your mahjong skills! Solo drills help you build fundamental skills, pattern recognition, and muscle memory. Practice these exercises regularly to sharpen your game.

## Why Solo Practice Matters

**Benefits:**
- Practice on your schedule
- Focus on specific weaknesses
- Build speed and confidence
- Deepen understanding without game pressure
- Perfect for learning before playing with others

**What you can practice alone:**
- Tile recognition speed
- Hand evaluation
- Pattern recognition
- Counting and probability
- Setup and teardown efficiency

## Drill 1: Speed Tile Recognition

**Goal:** Instantly identify any tile shown to you

**Setup:**
- Use a complete mahjong set
- Have someone show you random tiles, or
- Draw tiles randomly yourself

**Exercise:**
1. Shuffle all tiles face-down
2. Draw one tile
3. Identify it immediately (suit, number/honor, count)
4. Repeat for 2 minutes
5. Track your accuracy

**Progression:**
- Week 1: 3 seconds per tile
- Week 2: 2 seconds per tile
- Week 3: 1 second per tile
- Week 4+: Instant recognition

**Success metric:** 95%+ accuracy at 1 second per tile

## Drill 2: Valid Hand Verification

**Goal:** Quickly determine if a 14-tile set is a winning hand

**Setup:**
- Deal yourself 14 random tiles
- Organize them to see if they form a valid win

**Exercise:**
1. Deal 14 random tiles
2. Try to arrange into 4 sets + 1 pair
3. Determine: Valid win or not?
4. Time yourself
5. Repeat 10 times

**Variations:**
- Easy: Allow yourself 2 minutes per hand
- Medium: 1 minute per hand
- Hard: 30 seconds per hand
- Expert: 15 seconds per hand

**Success metric:** 90%+ accuracy in under 30 seconds

## Drill 3: Hand Efficiency Practice

**Goal:** Recognize which tiles to discard for maximum hand improvement

**Setup:**
- Deal yourself 13 tiles
- Evaluate what to discard

**Exercise:**
1. Deal 13 random tiles
2. Organize by suit
3. Identify:
   - Which tiles form sets/pairs?
   - Which tiles are isolated?
   - What patterns could you pursue?
   - What should you discard first?
4. Write down your discard
5. Draw a new tile and repeat
6. Continue for 10 draws

**Self-check questions:**
- Did I keep tiles that work together?
- Did I discard isolated tiles first?
- Am I working toward a specific pattern?
- Could I have made a better choice?

## Drill 4: Shanten Counting

**Goal:** Determine how many tiles away from ready (tenpai) you are

**Background:**
- **0 shanten** = Ready (tenpai), 1 tile away from winning
- **1 shanten** = 2 tiles away from winning
- **2 shanten** = 3 tiles away from winning
- etc.

**Setup:**
- Deal yourself 13 tiles

**Exercise:**
1. Organize your hand
2. Count minimum tiles needed to reach ready
3. Identify which tiles would help most
4. Practice with different random hands

**Example:**
```
Your hand (13 tiles):
2-3-4 Bam (complete set) ✓
5-5 Dot (pair) ✓
7-8 Wan (incomplete run, need 6 or 9)
3-4 Dot (incomplete run, need 2 or 5)
East, West (two isolated honors)

Shanten count:
- Have 1 complete set
- Have 1 pair
- Need 3 more sets
- Have 2 partial sets (need 2 tiles to complete both)
- Have 2 useless tiles

Answer: 2 shanten (need 2 tiles to reach ready)
```

**Progression:**
- Start with recognizing 0 shanten (ready hands)
- Then practice 1 shanten
- Advanced: Count 2-3 shanten quickly

## Drill 5: Pattern Recognition Flash Cards

**Goal:** Instantly recognize hand patterns

**Setup:**
- Create or download pattern examples
- Or deal specific pattern hands to yourself

**Exercise:**
1. Set up example hands with patterns:
   - All Simples
   - All Triplets
   - Half Flush
   - Full Flush
   - Seven Pairs
2. Look at each for 5 seconds
3. Identify all patterns present
4. Repeat until instant recognition

**Advanced variation:**
- Mix in hands WITHOUT patterns
- Identify: Pattern present or none?

## Drill 6: Simulated Game Play

**Goal:** Practice complete game flow solo

**Setup:**
- Full mahjong set
- Deal yourself 13 tiles

**Exercise:**
1. Deal 13 tiles as if you're one player
2. Draw from the wall
3. Evaluate your 14-tile hand
4. Decide what to discard
5. Repeat until you're ready or wall is exhausted
6. Track how many draws until ready

**Questions to ask:**
- How quickly did I reach ready?
- What pattern did my hand develop?
- Could I have reached ready faster?
- What were my critical decision points?

**Record your results:**
```
Game 1: Ready in 12 draws, pattern: All Simples
Game 2: Ready in 18 draws, pattern: Half Flush (Dots)
Game 3: Not ready, 24 draws (wall exhausted)
```

## Drill 7: Tile Counting Practice

**Goal:** Track which tiles have appeared

**Setup:**
- Mahjong set and paper

**Exercise:**
1. Draw 20 tiles randomly
2. Lay them face-up
3. Close your eyes or turn away
4. Recite from memory:
   - How many 5-Dots visible?
   - How many East Winds visible?
   - How many of each suit?
5. Check your accuracy

**Progression:**
- Week 1: Count one specific tile type
- Week 2: Count two specific tiles
- Week 3: Count all of one suit
- Advanced: Count multiple tiles simultaneously

## Drill 8: Probability Estimation

**Goal:** Understand likelihood of drawing needed tiles

**Setup:**
- Paper and pencil
- Mahjong set

**Exercise:**
1. Deal yourself 13 tiles
2. Identify what you're waiting for
3. Calculate:
   - How many copies exist? (usually 4)
   - How many are visible (in hand or simulated discards)?
   - How many remain in the wall?
   - What's the probability of drawing one?

**Example:**
```
Waiting for: 7-Dot
Total 7-Dots in set: 4
In your hand: 0
Visible (simulated discards): 2
Remaining in wall: 2
Tiles left in wall: 40

Probability: 2/40 = 5% per draw
```

**Advanced:**
- Calculate for multiple wait tiles
- Factor in dead wall tiles
- Estimate over multiple draws

## Drill 9: Setup Speed Challenge

**Goal:** Build and break the wall quickly and accurately

**Setup:**
- Complete mahjong set
- Timer

**Exercise:**
1. Start with all tiles mixed
2. Time yourself:
   - Build an 18×2 wall
   - Must be straight and neat
   - All tiles face-down
3. Record your time
4. Break down and repeat

**Targets:**
- Beginner: 5 minutes
- Intermediate: 3 minutes
- Advanced: 2 minutes
- Expert: 1.5 minutes

## Drill 10: Defensive Tile Selection

**Goal:** Practice identifying safe discards

**Setup:**
- Deal tiles and create "simulated" opponent discards

**Exercise:**
1. Deal yourself 13 tiles
2. Lay out 10 random tiles as "opponent discards"
3. Draw a 14th tile
4. Identify safest discard:
   - Matches opponent discards?
   - Doesn't complete obvious patterns?
   - Isolated tile?
5. Practice reasoning through the choice

## Creating a Practice Schedule

### Daily Practice (15-20 minutes)

**Monday:** Speed tile recognition (5 min) + Hand verification (10 min)
**Tuesday:** Shanten counting (10 min) + Pattern recognition (10 min)
**Wednesday:** Simulated game play (20 min)
**Thursday:** Tile counting (10 min) + Defensive selection (10 min)
**Friday:** Your choice / weakest area (20 min)
**Weekend:** Play actual games online or with friends!

### Weekly Goals

Track your progress:
```
Week 1:
- Tile recognition: 2 sec per tile, 85% accuracy
- Hand verification: 45 sec per hand
- Shanten counting: Consistently identify 0-1 shanten

Week 2:
- Tile recognition: 1.5 sec per tile, 90% accuracy
- Hand verification: 30 sec per hand
- Shanten counting: Identify up to 2 shanten
...
```

## Measuring Progress

**Key metrics:**
- Speed: How fast can you recognize/evaluate?
- Accuracy: How often are you correct?
- Consistency: Can you replicate results?
- Confidence: Do you feel sure of your decisions?

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Am I faster than last week?
- Am I making fewer mistakes?
- Do I understand WHY I made errors?
- Can I explain my reasoning?

## Tools & Resources

**Physical tools:**
- Mahjong set (obviously!)
- Timer/stopwatch
- Notebook for tracking
- Practice log (see resources)

**Digital tools:**
- Mahjong apps for pattern drills
- Online tile recognition trainers
- Scoring calculators
- Pattern reference charts

## Common Practice Mistakes

- ❌ Practicing speed without accuracy
- ❌ Only practicing easy drills
- ❌ Not tracking progress
- ❌ Irregular practice schedule
- ❌ Not applying practice to actual games
- ❌ Practicing in isolation without feedback

## Next Steps

**Combine solo practice with:**
- [Online Practice](online-practice.md) - Play against others
- [Common Mistakes](common-mistakes.md) - Learn what to avoid
- Regular games with friends

**Remember:** Solo drills build skills, but real games build experience. Balance both!

---

**Key Takeaway:** Consistent, focused practice builds mastery. Even 15 minutes daily will dramatically improve your game!
