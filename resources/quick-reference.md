## Winning Hand Formula

```
4 Sets + 1 Pair = 14 Tiles

Sets = Pong (triplet) OR Kong (quad) OR Chow (run)
Pair = 2 identical tiles
```

## Valid Sets

| Type | Tiles | Example | Notes |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Pong** | 3 identical | 5-5-5 Dot | Any player can call |
| **Kong** | 4 identical | East-East-East-East | Draw replacement tile |
| **Chow** | 3 consecutive, same suit | 3-4-5 Bam | Only from left player |
| **Pair** | 2 identical | Red-Red | Exactly one per hand |

## Tile Counts

- **Total tiles**: 144
- **Suited tiles**: 108 (Bamboo, Characters, Dots)
  - Each suit: 1-9, four copies each
- **Honor tiles**: 28
  - Winds: 4 types × 4 copies = 16
  - Dragons: 3 types × 4 copies = 12
- **Bonus tiles**: 8 (4 flowers + 4 seasons)

## Turn Structure

```
1. DRAW (take tile from wall)
2. EVALUATE (look at your 14 tiles)
3. DISCARD (throw one tile face-up)

Exception: East's first turn starts at step 2
```

## Calling Priority

When someone discards:

1. **Mahjong/Win** (highest) - anyone
2. **Pong/Kong** (high) - anyone
3. **Chow** (lowest) - left player only

## Turn Order

```
Counterclockwise:
East → North → West → South → East
```

## Seating Positions

```
        North
         ↑
    West → → East (Dealer)
         ↓
        South
```

## Common Patterns & Values

| Pattern | Description | Typical Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **All Simples** | All tiles 2-8, no terminals/honors | 1 double |
| **Pung** (All Triplets) | 4 Pongs/Kongs, no Chows | 2 doubles |
| **Value Tile** | Pong of dragon or wind | 1 double each |
| **Half Flush** | One suit + honors | 2-3 doubles |
| **Full Flush** | All one suit, no honors | 5-6 doubles |
| **Seven Pairs** | 7 different pairs | 2-4 doubles |

## Doubles Progression

| Doubles | Multiplier | Example Score (base 4) |
|---------|------------|------------------------|
| 0 | ×1 | 4 points |
| 1 | ×2 | 8 points |
| 2 | ×4 | 16 points |
| 3 | ×8 | 32 points |
| 4 | ×16 | 64 points |
| 5+ | Limit | 100-500+ points |

## Safe Discard Guidelines

**Safest:**
- ✓ Tiles opponent already discarded
- ✓ Tiles visible in opponent's exposed sets
- ✓ Fourth copy of any tile
- ✓ Tiles discarded by multiple players

**Most Dangerous:**
- ✗ Tiles no one has discarded
- ✗ Middle tiles (4-5-6) in late game
- ✗ Tiles matching opponent's pattern
- ✗ Tiles near opponent's exposed runs

## Reading Opponent Signals

| What You See | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| All Bamboo discarded | Going for Char/Dot flush |
| No honors discarded | Collecting winds/dragons |
| Only terminals discarded | Going for All Simples |
| Multiple same-suit Chows | Pursuing flush in that suit |
| Three exposed sets | Very close to winning! |

## Setup Quick Guide

1. Determine seats (random wind draw)
2. Each player takes 36 tiles
3. Build walls (18 stacks × 2 high)
4. Push walls together (square)
5. East rolls dice → determine which wall
6. That player rolls → determine break point
7. Separate dead wall (last 7 stacks)
8. Deal: 3 rounds of 4 tiles + 1 tile each
9. East gets one more (14 total)
10. Reveal flowers/seasons, draw replacements
11. Ready to play!

## Key Rules Reminders

**✓ DO:**
- Reveal flowers/seasons immediately
- Count tiles before declaring Mahjong
- Discard after calling Pong/Kong/Chow
- Call clearly and loudly
- Draw replacement for Kongs

**✗ DON'T:**
- Mix suits in Chows (must be same suit!)
- Call Chow from anyone but left player
- Forget to discard after calling
- Declare Mahjong with wrong tile count
- Discard without thinking in late game

## Wait Types

| Type | Example | Waiting For | Strength |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Two-sided** | 5-6 Bam | 4 or 7 Bam | Best! |
| **Closed** | 4-6 Dot | 5-Dot | Medium |
| **Edge** | 8-9 Wan | 7-Wan | Weak |
| **Pair** | Red-Red (need pair) | Red Dragon | Weak |

## Flower/Season Bonuses

**When drawn:**
1. Reveal immediately
2. Place face-up in front of you
3. Draw replacement from dead wall
4. Continue turn

**Scoring bonus:**
- Own flower/season: extra points
- All 4 flowers: extra points
- All 4 seasons: extra points

## Payment Structure

**Self-Draw (Zi Mo):**
- All 3 opponents pay you
- Usually higher value

**Win on Discard:**
- Only discarder pays
- Sometimes pays for all 3

**Dealer Multipliers:**
- Dealer wins: higher payment
- Dealer loses: higher payment

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. ❌ Wrapping sequences (8-9-1)
2. ❌ Mixing suits in runs
3. ❌ Calling Chow from wrong player
4. ❌ Forgetting to discard after calling
5. ❌ Not revealing flowers
6. ❌ Declaring with wrong tile count
7. ❌ Breaking ready for unlikely improvements
8. ❌ Not watching opponent discards

## Hand Evaluation Checklist

Before discarding, ask:

- [ ] What pairs do I have?
- [ ] What sets are complete/almost complete?
- [ ] What pattern am I pursuing?
- [ ] Is this discard safe?
- [ ] How close am I to ready?

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Someone discards a tile:

Can I win with it?
  YES → Call "Mahjong!" → Win!
  NO ↓

Can I Pong/Kong?
  YES → Do I want to?
    YES → Call it
    NO → Pass
  NO ↓

Can I Chow? (left player only)
  YES → Do I want to?
    YES → Call it
    NO → Pass
  NO → Pass

Next player's turn
```

## Critical Numbers

- **Winning hand**: exactly 14 tiles (15 with Kong)
- **Ready**: 13 tiles, one away from winning
- **Sets needed**: 4 sets + 1 pair
- **Typical win rate**: 20-30% (1 in 4-5 games)
- **Dead wall**: 14 tiles (7 stacks)

## Terminology Quick Lookup

| English | Mandarin | Cantonese |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Triplet | Pong | Pong |
| Quad | Kong | Kong |
| Run | Chow | Sheung/Seung |
| Win | Hu | Sik/Sek |
| Self-draw | Zi Mo | Zi Mo |
| Ready | Ting Pai | Ting Pai |

## Point Calculation (Simplified)

```
Base Points: 4 (typical starting value)
Multiply by: 2^(number of doubles)
Add: Bonuses (flowers, kongs, etc.)

Example:
- Base: 4
- Doubles: 3 (All Simples + 2 Value Tiles)
- Calculation: 4 × 2³ = 4 × 8 = 32 points
```
