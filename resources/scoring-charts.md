# Scoring Charts

Detailed scoring reference for Chinese Classical Mahjong. Note that scoring varies significantly by house rules - use these as guidelines and adjust to your group's preferences.

## Important Note

**Chinese Classical Mahjong has many scoring systems:**
- Hong Kong Old Style
- Taiwanese
- Cantonese
- Modern Chinese Official (MCR)
- Simplified house rules

**This guide provides general frameworks.** Always agree on scoring rules before playing!

## Basic Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = Base Points × 2^(Doubles) + Bonuses

Where:
- Base Points: Starting value (typically 2-10)
- Doubles: Multipliers from patterns
- Bonuses: Flowers, kongs, etc.
```

## Common Base Point Systems

### System 1: Fixed Base (Simplest)

```
All hands start at 4 base points
Doubles multiply from there
```

### System 2: Variable Base

```
Base depends on hand composition:
- All Chows: 2 points
- Mixed Chows and Pongs: 4 points
- All Pongs: 6 points
- Special patterns: 8-10 points
```

### System 3: Counting Fu (Advanced)

Complex system counting specific tile combinations. Not recommended for beginners.

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Hand

**Hand:**
```
2-3-4 Bam (Chow)
5-5-5 Dot (Pong)
7-8-9 Wan (Chow)
3-4-5 Dot (Chow)
6-6 Bam (Pair)
```

**Scoring:**
- All Simples: 1 double
- Concealed (if applicable): 1 double
- Total: 2 doubles

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 2
Score: 4 × 2² = 4 × 4 = 16 points
```

### Example 2: Value Hand

**Hand:**
```
1-2-3 Bam (Chow)
Red-Red-Red (Pong - Dragon)
East-East-East (Pong - your seat wind, round is East)
6-7-8 Wan (Chow)
5-5 Dot (Pair)
```

**Scoring:**
- Red Dragon: 1 double
- Seat Wind (East): 1 double
- Round Wind (East): 1 double (same Pong!)
- Total: 3 doubles

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 3
Score: 4 × 2³ = 4 × 8 = 32 points
```

### Example 3: Flush Hand

**Hand (all Dots + honors):**
```
2-3-4 Dot (Chow)
5-6-7 Dot (Chow)
8-8-8 Dot (Pong)
Green-Green-Green (Dragon)

- Green Dragon: 1 double
- Total: 4 doubles

**Calculation:**
```
Base: 4 points
Doubles: 4
Score: 4 × 2⁴ = 4 × 16 = 64 points
```

### Example 4: Limit Hand

**Hand:**
```
Thirteen Orphans:
1-Bam, 9-Bam, 1-Dot, 9-Dot, 1-Wan, 9-Wan,
East, South, West, North, Red, Green, White, White (pair)
```

**Scoring:**
- Limit Hand (Thirteen Orphans)
- Automatic maximum

**Score:** LIMIT (e.g., 500 points)

## Payment Tables

### Self-Draw Payment

**Equal Payment (common in casual play):**
```
Each loser pays: Total Score ÷ 3
Winner receives: Total Score

Example: 48 points total
Each loser pays: 16 points
Winner receives: 48 points
```

**Dealer Double (traditional):**
```
If dealer wins:
  Each loser pays: Total Score × 2
  Dealer receives: Total Score × 6

If non-dealer wins:
  Dealer pays: Total Score × 2
  Non-dealers pay: Total Score each
  Winner receives total
```

### Win on Discard Payment

**Option 1: Discarder Pays All**
```
Discarder pays: Total Score × 3
Winner receives: Total Score × 3
Others pay: 0
```

**Option 2: Discarder Pays Normal**
```

```

## Simplified Scoring System (For Beginners)

**Fixed point values per pattern:**

```
Basic win: 10 points
All Simples: +5 points
Value Tile (each): +5 points
All Triplets: +10 points
Half Flush: +20 points
Full Flush: +40 points
Seven Pairs: +15 points
Self-draw: +5 points
Own flower/season: +5 points

Maximum: 100 points
```

**Example:**
```
All Simples (5) + Red Dragon (5) + Self-draw (5) = 25 points total
```

This system is much easier for learning!

## Scoring Tips

1. **Start simple** - Use fixed values before complex calculations
2. **Agree beforehand** - Clarify rules before playing
3. **Use charts** - Keep references handy
4. **Calculator OK** - No shame in using tools
5. **Focus on gameplay** - Don't let scoring slow down fun
6. **Learn patterns** - Knowing values helps strategy

## Common Scoring Mistakes

- ❌ Forgetting to count multiple bonuses from same Pong (seat + round wind)
- ❌ Not counting flowers in final score
- ❌ Miscounting doubles (exponential, not additive!)
- ❌ Forgetting dealer multipliers
- ❌ Confusing concealed vs. exposed values
- ❌ Not applying limit caps
